To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW™ COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min.

Almost all countries have been affected and some of them are now experiencing a rampant rise of disease cases with severe consequences on the stability of health systems. Since disease probable emergence in a wet market of Wuhan, city in the Hubei region of China and recognition of its causative agent, a number of studies on SARS-CoV-2 genome have been published and showed its close similarities (and differences) with the genomes of other coronaviruses isolated from bat, snake, pangolin and SARS CoV. 20 -22 Now the attention of most investigators is focused on the potential capability of the viral genome to evolve through mutation, recombination and gene gain and losses, as verified in other human coronaviruses. 23 Despite contrary expectations, the selective pressure analysis reported here points out that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has so far undergone very few mutations, which mostly affect the 3rd codon, and are synonymous, meaning are not going to influence the general molecular structure of this new virus. In addition, it remains difficult to prove the biological relevance of these mutations by pure bioinformatic approach, in the absence of experimental correlates. To somewhat overcome these difficulties, we have here joined bioinformatic and phylogenetic with structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by mutated genes, in an attempt to obtain some insights into the ',\n",

After the first cases of SARS-CoV-2-related disease also known as COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan, China, the spread throughout the world has been extremely dramatic [3] . On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), later officially upgrading it as a global pandemic.',\n",
       " 'The clinical presentations are protean. In 88% of cases, fever is the most common presentation, followed by cough (68%), vomiting (5%), and diarrhea (3.8%). ARDS, multi-organ failure including acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation are some of the dreaded complications in 15% of these patients often being the cause of death [4] . The presence of strict airborne isolation limits the utilization of computed tomography angiogram scans in these patients. There has been a wide institutional variation based on the number of suspected and diagnosed cases of COVID-19 as well as CT-scan machines available in a given hospital. In addition to this, the presence of acute renal injury or contrast allergy can also preclude the use of this gold standard modality in diagnosing PE in these patients [5] . Patients with COVID-19 have increased risk of venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation has been well described in studies from China and Italy.',\n",

COVID-19, however, being an inflammatory state can cause an elevation of D-dimer; hence most of these low-risk patients may end up needing a CTA for PE evaluation. For these patients, as well as for patients with high Well's score, we describe the MOU technique as a good alternative to diagnosing PE in individuals with COVID-19 ARDS [6] . This can limit the exposure in healthcare settings to this extremely contagious disease. It is also a reasonable alternative for patients with contraindication to contrast use. An isolated echocardiogram or ultrasound of lower extremities may not achieve the same degree of sensitivity, but when combined they are 88% sensitive and 90% specific when compared to a CT angiogram [7] .\",\n",

The underlying etiology of his worsening respiratory status was a likely sudden exacerbation of his viral illness and also contributed by acute PE. The patient underwent an MOU of the bilateral lower extremities as well as an echocardiogram. This not only helps in diagnosing deep venous thrombosis as the cause of his acute PE but also helped to quantify the severity using risk calculators. BOVA score, which predicts the PE-related complications in acutely sick patients, was high in our patient (BOVA score of 5). This suggests a high risk (42 %) of 30-day death from PE-related complications like hemodynamic collapse and recurrent PE [8] .',\n",
       " \"Traditionally, echocardiography is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of PE. However, in patients with COVID-19, it remains an essential tool to look for signs of PE. It is an easy and quick method and useful to predict mortality in critically ill patients. Moderate or severe RV hypokinesis, persistent pulmonary hypertension, a patent foramen ovale, and freefloating right-heart thrombus are echocardiographic markers that identify patients at risk for death or recurrent thromboembolism. McConnell's sign with a free-floating RV clot in our patient suggested a massive PE [9] . Fortunately, our patient's hemodynamics including blood pressure stayed stable. He was carefully monitored in the intensive care unit with plans for further management including thrombolysis or thrombectomy in case he developed signs of hemodynamic instability [10, 11] . With therapeutic heparin along with ventilator support for COVID-19, the patient gradually improved and his inflammatory markers trended down and was ultimately extubated. Heparin was transitioned to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) rivaroxaban.\",\n",

We describe a case of acute PE in a known case of COVID-19 infection. The correlation of viral infection and PE remains unclear due to the paucity of current literature. An MOU can help in diagnosing the source and severity of PE and help us decide appropriate management. It is important that healthcare workers are able to understand venous thromboembolism as an important differential diagnosis in patients with COVID-19, particularly in critically ill patients. We also focus on the ability to utilize MOU as a good alternative to gold standard CTA in diagnosing PE, in order to minimize exposure in healthcare settings, to conserve essential resources in resource-limited hospitals, and in patients in whom contrast use is prohibitive.',\n",

Bias may be introduced if the administered treatment regimen (including interruptions, delays, concomitant medications) in a trial is no longer representative of the intended treatment regimen. Two aspects appear to be particularly important when determining whether using treatment policy strategy to handle these ICEs is still meaningful: the potential relationship with disease progression and any effect of the treatment (e.g. immunosuppression), and interpretability of the data after the COVID-19 related ICEs, including if a patient starts new therapy or delays an intervention (e.g. surgery, transplant). For ICEs primarily caused by the disruption of healthcare systems or patients' desire to minimize travelling independently of disease or treatment, we suggest that the hypothetical strategy may be reasonable to address the clinical trial objective. Treatment policy strategy may be more appropriate for discontinuations, interruptions or delays related to COVID-19 infection. Principal stratification assessing the treatment effect in e.g. patients who would not experience severe complications of COVID-19 on either treatment arm may be considered as another alternative to provide insight on expected treatment benefit.

In addition to clarification of the estimand, changes in the sample size and/or trial duration to allow for the observation of additional events may need to be considered.

       " 'Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. Methods We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine has garnered unprecedented attention as a potential therapeutic option in the global COVID-19 pandemic. 39 Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown data that may support its possible efficacy, but clinical data are limited to small clinical trials and uncontrolled case series and cohorts. 20 There is an urgent need for the rigorous evaluation of hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic option against COVID-19. 40 This innovative trial is adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and its ability to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. The novel web-based design of this trial, in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic, has ensured that all interactions with participants, including enrolment and informed consent, are done remotely using courier services to deliver medicine and using internetbased follow-up. This will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others. The design encourages large scale enrolment to ensure the target number of participants are enrolled and trial results are obtained as quickly as possible. Importantly, the design was finalized, regulatory and REB approvals were obtained, and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration (within a few weeks of a global pandemic) with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time.',\n",
       " 'Recently, several public figures have promoted the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in the absence of robust scientific data. 39, 41 This trial will help address if large scale dissemination of hydroxychloroquine is appropriate in certain populations. Importantly, if this study shows a positive effect, this will support a new therapeutic option to mitigate the global spread and impact of COVID-19. If a null or negative effect is shown, this will reduce the risk of harm to future patients, reduce healthcare expenditures due to ineffective medications, and protect the drug supply for patients with previously established indications for hydroxychloroquine. The results of this trial will be instrumental in determining if hydroxychloroquine may play an important role in mitigating the global impact of COVID-19. ',\n",

It can also pinpoint the exact position of the lesions or inflammations caused by the COVID-19, and therefore can also potentially provide advice on patient severity in order to guide the following triage and treatment. Experimental findings have indicated that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, precision and AUC for the classification, as well as promising qualitative visualisation for the lesion detections.

       " 'Objective To assess potential methods of reducing visible aerosol generation during clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery in the era of Covid-19. Methods Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol production was recorded using high-speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes (2.2, 2.75 mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of the cornea with a static and moving tip. Results This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was noted with a 2.2-mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol was unrelated to corneal wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume toward the ocular surface. Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea. This effect lasted for an average of 67 ± 8 s in the static model. Visible aerosol generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip toward the corneal wound. Conclusions We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of clear corneal phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2-mm phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification.',\n",

       " 'Published simulations have attempted to model aerosol generation during phacoemulsification using video recording and application of the ultrasound energy at either an air-fluid interface or using model eyes [7, 8] . The former is not representative of the closed system that is required for effective and safe phacoemulsification. Similarly, model eyes have different structural properties to the human eye and findings using these models may be challenged on these grounds.',\n",
       " \"AACs are utilised in corneal graft surgery for donor tissue preparation [13] . Once the human corneoscleral rim is mounted on the AAC, a single leak-free chamber is formed allowing the maintenance of 'intraocular pressure'. This model allows simulated surgery for lamellar graft procedures using human cadaveric tissue and addresses the above limitations of other experimental models.\",\n",
       " \"We utilised a novel application of this model to consistently demonstrate the aerosol or 'vapour' plume that is observed in the real world setting during phacoemulsification with a 2.75-mm tip. The plume appears to originate from the corneal wound. This may be due to vibration transmitted from the phacoemulsification probe to the lip of the corneal wound. It is impossible to determine whether the aerosol generation seen with this experimental set up is due to agitation of moisture on the surface of the cornea or small amounts of BSS that can egress through the corneal wound around the probe. Visible aerosol following phacoemulsification with a dry cornea supports the latter. The reduction in visible aerosol seen with the 2.2-mm tip may be explained by less wound leakage. This was noted in an ex vivo study comparing wound leakage between 2.2-and 2.75-mm tips [14] .\",\n",
       " 'Following this, we evaluated different methods of attenuating this aerosol plume and demonstrate two potential approaches. The first approach involves forced air directed at the microsurgical field to disperse the aerosol downwards and laterally. In an operating theatre, this set up would be challenging as the air would have to be filtered and humidified to prevent infection and corneal drying respectively, with the setup of the microsurgical field to incorporate a suitable air flow device potentially being problematic. Portable surgical laminar flow systems used for cataract surgery may be configured to drive any aerosol produced away from healthcare workers, allowing precipitation onto surgical drapes and subsequent disposal.',\n",
       " 'Suction did not influence the plume despite close proximity of the Yankauer suction tip to its source and maximum suction. This is likely to be due to a limitation in the instrument used, as custom devices have been developed to effectively remove vapour during corneal ablation using excimer laser [15] .',\n",
       " 'The second approach uses HPMC 2% to coat the corneal surface during phacoemulsification. HPMC is a lowviscosity and moderate-viscoelasticity material commonly used to coat the cornea to improve intraocular visualisation during surgery and has proven safety [16] . It is notable that our findings are in agreement with those identified using model eyes [8] .',\n",
       " 'Analysis of video recordings highlight that visible aerosol generation is abolished when HPMC is applied to the corneal wound. This effect lasted for~1 min. It is possible that when HPMC coats the corneal wound and phacoemulsification probe, it acts as a barrier to either aerosol formation or dispersion. Its higher molecular weight and elasticity may also act as a damper to the ultrasonic energy preventing agitation and consequent aerosolisation. This effect was consistent using two different brands of HPMC and may apply to other types of viscoelastic materials. This effect was also noted with simulations using model eyes [8] .',\n",
       " \"Efforts to reproduce the longitudinal action of nuclear sculpting showed that, in contrast to the static model, visible aerosol was only produced when continuous phacoemulsification was performed close to the corneal wound despite HPMC coating. The close proximity of the ultrasound energy to the cornea may generate aerosol by either agitating the HPMC coat off the cornea or directly diminishing HPMC's barrier function. The reduced aerosol production at other points during the dynamic experiment may be due to less deformation of the corneal wound by the surgeon despite efforts to minimise this when using the static model and represents a limitation of this study. This study only analysed aerosol production using continuous torsional phacoemulsification and may not be representative of other modes of ultrasound energy delivery.\",\n",
       " 'This study investigated visible aerosol generation from phacoemulsification using a clear corneal wound and may not represent aerosol produced from a limbal corneal wound. As this study focused on visible aerosol generation only, it is impossible to comment on generation of invisible or ultrafine aerosol particles that are not discernible by this experimental setup. There is uncertainty about whether these particles can form in the absence of visible aerosol generation and if so, whether these particles pose a risk of transmitting Covid-19 disease to healthcare workers.',\n",

Currently, it is unknown whether viable SARS-CoV-2 particles can be aerosolised in sufficient quantities to form an effective inoculum for transmission to healthcare workers. The following should be considered when estimating this risk: is there an effective SARS-CoV-2 viral load present in or on the ocular tissues of an asymptomatic or undiagnosed patient undergoing cataract surgery, and is the visible aerosol plume formed during cataract surgery is composed of BSS or intraocular fluids. We offer suggestions to deal with these uncertainties.',\n",

Topical povidone-iodine is widely used in ophthalmic surgery for surgical antisepsis and would destroy any viable SARS-CoV-2 particles present on the ocular surface.',\n",
       " 'There may be concern that the aerosol generated by phacoemulsification could contain virus-infected intraocular fluid. The majority of this intraocular fluid is viscoexpressed before capsulorrhexis. The concern about any remaining infected intraocular fluid should be alleviated by applying statistical and mathematical principles. The mean volume of the anterior chamber measured with optical coherence tomography is 0.17 ± 0.04 ml [20] . If the volume of the anterior chamber is normally distributed, three standard deviations would 99.7% of the population would have an anterior chamber volume of less than 0.29 ml.',\n",
       " 'Phacoemulsification cataract surgery occurs in a closed system and irrigating/aspirating BSS through the anterior chamber with the phacoemulsification probe results in a dilution of intraocular fluid that obeys first order decay: for every 0.29 ml of BSS that passes through, the concentration of the original intraocular fluid is decreased by 50%. When 2.03 ml of BSS has circulated in the anterior chamber, the concentration is reduced to less than 1% of the original concentration. Using conventional aspiration rates ranging from 20 to 40 cc/min, this will take at most 3-6 s in 99.7% of the population. Performing this irrigation/aspiration step for an aspiration rate-dependent duration prior to phacoemulsification will significantly decrease the proportion of any remaining intraocular fluid (and consequently any theoretical virus load) in any aerosol produced.',\n",
       " 'We then investigated methods of mitigating of any potential risk from the aerosol produced by phacoemulsification, with the prospect of aiding the resumption of elective cataract surgery as we navigate through this pandemic. Findings from the study show that use of a 2.2-mm phacoemulsification tip where possible and copious administration of HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification reduces visible aerosol generation.',\n",

However, existing prediction tools have limited ability to accommodate scarce or fragmented training data currently available. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn predictors that can generalize or extrapolate beyond the heterogeneous data. Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization, adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data, molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening data for SARS-CoV-1. Our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by significant margin.

       " \"Les RCP sont aujourd'hui très bien implantées dans toutes les régions françaises, avec, selon le résultat de la dernière campagne de 2017 des indicateurs pour l'amélioration de la qualité et de la sécurité des soins IPAQSS-RCP de la Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), une exhaustivité médiane de 89 % des nouveaux patients dont le dossier est discuté en RCP et tracé dans une FRCP [8] . En Occitanie, la quasi-totalité des FRCP sont tracées dans le DCC porté par le réseau régional Onco-Occitanie. Seules quatre RCP ne sont pas informatisées dans le DCC à ce jour. Si l'on s'intéresse aux indicateurs globaux de l'impact du confinement sur les RCP, on note que 8 à 10 % des réunions ne se sont pas tenues après le 16 mars, et que ce chiffre est resté stable pendant le mois suivant le début du confinement, mais que, passé ce délai, l'activité semble reprendre puisque le nombre de réunions, bien que n'augmentant pas, redevient comparable à la période équivalente en 2019. Ces deux périodes comprenant le lundi de Pâques, cela explique le plus faible nombre de réunions. Le nombre de dossiers discutés a diminué bien au-delà de ce que l'on pouvait attendre au vu de la diminution du nombre de réunions. La baisse de 23 % du nombre total de dossiers peut s'expliquer par la restriction de la discussion aux dossiers importants et incontournables par la RCP, mais la baisse identique du nombre de dossiers présentés en RCP pour la première fois nous indique que des retards au diagnostic et/ou à la mise en route des traitements sont à envisager. Les résultats de la dernière période (respectivement 33 et 39 %) semblent indiquer que la situation empire, même s'il faut rester prudent dans l'interprétation car les données de 2019 montraient aussi une diminution d'activité sur la période comparable. Le nombre total de médecins présents en réunion a lui aussi fortement diminué (-25 % sur la première période et -16 % sur la deuxième période). Il peut s'agir d'une adaptation progressive des équipes aux recommandations de distanciation physique par la visioconférence ou par l'organisation dans de bonnes conditions des RCP présentielles mais cela peut aussi correspondre, dans certains établissements, à une moindre disponibilité des médecins car mobilisés pour les activités supplémentaires liées à la prise en charge des patients Covid+. On constate qu'environ 10 % des RCP enregistrées dans le DCC fonctionnent habituellement avec un quorum inférieur aux trois médecins recommandés, ce qui peut être considéré comme une non-conformité mais qui peut aussi avoir d'autres raisons : la validation de dossiers standards enregistrés dans le DCC par le seul coordinateur (procédure permise par l'outil), un quorum différent pour certaines RCP transversales ou plus simplement un défaut de traçabilité dans le DCC. Le réseau a entrepris plusieurs actions cette année pour améliorer la traçabilité des médecins en RCP, ce qui a porté de 10 % en moyenne à 8 % en début d'année 2020 la proportion de RCP dont le quorum était inférieur à trois. Nous observons que dans la période de quinze jours suivant le confinement, ce nombre est passé à 14 %, pouvant traduire un défaut de traçabilité, comme une diminution réelle de la conformité de ces RCP, avant de revenir immédiatement après à des valeurs plus classiques. Si on note que la diminution a été générale et importante concernant les dossiers discutés et les premières présentations, on note un retentissement plus important et plus précoce sur le nombre moyen de dossiers discutés en Oc-M, où le retentissement de l'épidémie a été ressenti plus tôt et de façon plus importante [9] . De la même façon, les RCP territoriales semblent avoir été plus rapidement impactées que les RCP de Recours. Cependant, les RCP de recours semblent présenter une diminution d'activité en fin de période. On observe la même dissociation entre RCP d'organe et RCP transverses. L'activité des RCP d'organe chute immédiatement après le 16 mars, alors que pour les RCP transverses cette chute est retardée à la troisième quinzaine. La baisse d'activité rapide des RCP d'organe et des RCP territoriales, qui sont souvent les mêmes et qui se tiennent dans des établissements non spécialisés en cancérologie, pourrait être liée à la baisse des ressources médicales en capacité d'animer les réunions, et qui sont mobilisées dans le cadre de l'épidémie. La baisse secondaire des RCP transverses et des RCP de recours serait en revanche la conséquence de la baisse de l'activité en cancérologie. En conclusion, cette étude montre que la majorité des RCP continue de fonctionner pendant l'épidémie et qu'elles se sont adaptées avec moins de médecins présents dans les réunions. La baisse du nombre total de dossiers peut traduire une adaptation normale de la RCP pour sélectionner les dossiers importants à discuter, mais la baisse majeure et continue du nombre de premières présentations renforce l'idée que les patients ont été moins adressés avec un diagnostic de cancer dans une proportion de près de 40 % sur la dernière période. Ceci peut être lié à une baisse de l'activité diagnostique (moins de dépistage, moins de consultations chez le médecin généraliste ou spécialiste d'organe) ou de l'accès aux examens complémentaires, mais aussi par une diminution dans certains établissements des programmes chirurgicaux (baisse des premières présentations en RCP post-opératoire). Cette première étude quantitative est bien sûr à poursuivre pour observer l'évolution de l'activité des RCP et en voir un rattrapage éventuel. Elle sera complétée par une enquête qualitative (en cours) auprès des coordonnateurs de RCP pour savoir comment ils se sont organisés et adaptés à la situation.

We aim to equip local public health decision-and policy-makers with mathematical model-based quantification of implemented public health measures and estimation of the trend of COVID-19 in Ontario to inform future actions in terms of outbreak control and de-escalation of social distancing. Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact. We show that improved case detection rate plays a decisive role to reduce the effective reproduction number, and there is still much room in terms of improving personal protection measures to compensate for the strict social distancing measures.',\n",

On March 17th, Ontario declared state of emergency and, after an initial transition, as of March 24th at midnight, closure of all non-essential workplaces becomes mandatory and effective.',\n",
       " 'In the present study, using the COVID-19 incidence report data from February 26th to April 13, we estimated key epidemiological and intervention parameters of a disease transmission model in Ontario. We estimated the transmission risk and studied the impact of public health interventions implemented by Ontario, we also estimated the probability of individuals presenting symptoms, which is consistent with previously established estimates [16] . While the control reproduction number had been decreasing with time, our simulations based on data as of March 29 indicated that further compliance with measures and additional interventions were needed to reduce below the control threshold of 1. We pointed out that a combination of additional reduction of contacts and increasing the detection rate would help to reduce the effective reproduction number to under the unity for disease control, and our estimation and analysis based on time series of cumulative reported cases since March 24 confirmed this strategy worked: since the closure of nonessential business and increasing the detection rate since March 24, we noted rapid decline of the effective reproduction number and the fast approaching of the epidemic peaks.',\n",

As a result, the control reproduction numbers estimated using the different time intervals decreased from 3.25 to 2.97 and 2.84, indicating a gradually increasing effectiveness of the interventions adopted. Further, we illustrated how the control interventions adopted by the government and the public have begun to play an important role in mitigating the epidemic in Ontario since March 21st (Fig. 2) . Using the estimated parameters and based on the model, we predicted the number of cumulative confirmed cases as of April 7th to be 6132 (95% CI 4250-8000) (Fig. 3(A) ), and we noted that this could have been further reduced by ∼ 50% by decreasing the contact rates from March 30th to April 7th by 90% (Fig. 3(B) ). Hence the level of compliance with social distancing advisories by the public and the increasing capacity of case detection can influence the future trend of the epidemic.',\n",
       " 'Comparing the estimates from the three different time intervals before the closure of non-essential business, we conclude that the intervention efforts and control measures, such as lockdown and social distancing advisories, was effective in reducing the personto-person contact rate (Table 1 ). We also estimated that proportionally more cases are being quarantined which had contributed to the decrease of the control reproduction number (Table 1) . However, the estimated transmission efficacy was not changed significantly since the adoption of controls (Table 1) until March 24, indicating that the intensity of personal protections against effective contacts was not improved. Although the control reproduction number by March 24 had decreased, it was still close to 3 and would be below 1 only if the effective contact rate (the contact rate times the transmission probability per contact) is reduced by 2/3. Therefore, there should be persistent control efforts in reducing contact rate and the duration of infection of infectious individuals, which is possible with a fast case detection rate and effective isolation measures. We confirmed that this was indeed achieved two weeks after the closure of non-essential business and the improved testing.',\n",
       " 'We also considered the scenario that some of the efforts might have reached their maximum level by social distancing and self-isolation recommendations before the closure of non-essential business on March 24, so decreasing transmission efficacy by boosting personal protection could be a mitigation option. Using simulations, we illustrated the impact of reducing transmission efficacy on future cumulative number of confirmed cases, epidemic peak time, and peak number of infections as shown in Fig. 4(A) and Fig. 4(B) . We also simulated the role of increasing testing which leads to increase in the case confirmation rate and suggested the possibility of a combination of rapid testing and effective quarantine ( Fig. 4(D, E, F) ) in reducing the case number and reducing the control reproduction number. Overall, the contact rate, transmission probability, detection/diagnose rate, and quarantine rate are key factors that influence the control reproduction number (Fig. 4(C), Fig. 4 (F) and Fig. 4(I) ).',\n",
       " 'While epidemic control in Ontario was achieved with reduction of contacts and increase of detection rate during the period from March 24 to April 13 as shown in Fig. 5 , our simulations show that there is still much room for improvement in personal protection. This is an encouraging news for Ontarians to plan for their social distancing de-escalation strategy, as increasing personal protection may compensate a certain degree of social distancing relaxation. Social distancing advisories, closures, among the package of implemented control measures have assisted in reducing disease transmission; however, personal protection may admit further reduction in forward transmission. Personal protection in the form of improved hygiene such as handwashing, reduction of face-touching, and the appropriate utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) offers the convenience of being actionable by all individuals in the public and may mitigate future COVID-19 transmission in Ontario. Mask wearing and instant hand wiping has been proposed and supported to mitigate transmission of COVID-19, and recent findings indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses from symptomatic individuals [14, 17] . In this light, Ontarians should intensify its effort in acquiring protective supplies such as masks and protective clothing, and develop an optimal distribution strategy if supplies are in insufficient supply.',\n",
       " \"Respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are spread through a susceptible individual's contact with infectious agents. These contacts facilitate disease transmission and can be made indirectly through environmental routes or through direct person-toperson interaction. PPE, such as surgical and N95 masks, are utilized with the aim of reducing the likelihood of disease transmission either from an asymptomatic infection to susceptible contacts, or upon an individual's exposure to an infectious agent such as a cough or sneeze carrying a pathogenic load. However, as in the case of surgical and N95 masks, PPE may not be tested or efficacious for conditions which they may see in practice, including a range of plausible human respiratory emissions containing pathogenic loads [18, 19] . Further, no studies have directly evaluated the biophysics of droplets and gas formation for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 [18] . Lastly, in some regions, the availability of surgical masks may be limited in light of the high demand and recent production decreases [20] . All these points emphasize the urgent need for a mechanistic and comprehensive understanding of respiratory disease transmission, in order to effectively design PPE and enhance COVID-19 mitigation strategies such as social distancing. These points highlight several of the current challenges and difficulties of PPE adequately reducing disease transmission, warranting further research.\",\n",

       " 'Within a time span of only a few months, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has managed to spread across the world. This virus can spread by close contact, which includes large droplet spray and inhalation of microscopic droplets, and by indirect contact via contaminated objects. While in most countries, supermarkets have remained open, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities have ordered many other shops, restaurants, bars, music theaters and indoor sports centers to be closed. As part of COVID-19 (semi)lock-down exit strategies, many government authorities are now (May 2020) allowing a gradual re-opening, where sometimes indoor sport centers are last in line to be permitted to re-open. This technical note discusses the challenges in re-opening these facilities and the measures already suggested by some to tackle these challenges. It also elaborates three potential additional measures and based on these additional measures, it suggests the concept of a certificate of equivalence that could allow indoor sports centers with such a certificate to re-open more rapidly. It also attempts to stimulate increased preparedness of indoor sports centers for potential next waves of SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics. It is concluded that fighting situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic and limiting economic damage requires increased collaboration and research by virologists, epidemiologists, microbiologists, aerosol scientists, building physicists, building services engineers and sports scientists.',\n",

There is potential for aerosolization of sweat, but the measures suggested to mitigate transmission from respiratory droplets and aerosols also apply to aerosolized sweat. If the virus is shed in sweat, probably the bigger concern is the contact route: people leaving behind sweat on machines, either high-touch areas of cardio machines or the seats and handles of weight machines and free weights/benches. This could be tackled by the guidelines in [29] .',\n",

This additional monitoring could also be used to control both the settings of the ventilation and the potentially present ESPs.',\n",

       " 'Objective Pregnant women have been historically excluded from clinical trials for nonobstetric conditions, even during prior epidemics. The objective of this review is to describe the current state of research for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Study Design We conducted a search of international trial registries for trials relating to the novel coronavirus. The eligibility criteria for each trial were reviewed for inclusion/ exclusion of pregnant women. Relevant data were extracted and descriptive statistics were calculated for individual and combined data. The total number of trials from each registry were compared, as well as the proportions of pregnancy-related trials within each. Results Among 621,370 trials in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, 927 (0.15%) were COVID-19 related. Of those, the majority (52%) explicitly excluded pregnancy or failed to address pregnancy at all (46%) and only 16 (1.7%) were pregnancy specific. When categorized by region, 688 (74.2%) of COVID-19 trials were in Asia, followed by 128 (13.8%) in Europe, and 66 (7.2%) in North America. Of the COVID-19 trials which included pregnant women, only three were randomized-controlled drug trials. Conclusion Approximately 1.7% of current COVID-19 research is pregnancy related and the majority of trials either explicitly exclude or fail to address pregnancy. Only three interventional trials worldwide involved pregnant women. The knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of interventions for COVID-19 created by the exclusion of pregnant women may ultimately harm them. While \"ethical\" concerns about fetal exposure are often cited, it is in fact unethical to habitually exclude pregnant women from research.',\n",
       " 'In this study, we demonstrated that less than 2% of all COVID-19 registered trials include pregnant women, and only 3 were randomized-controlled trials involving the use of a medication/supplement (1.8% of all COVID-19 randomized interventional trials). This dismal inclusion of pregnant women in clinical therapeutic research is not only disappointing but misguided, unjustified, and unfortunately familiar.',\n",
       " 'In 1993, the National Institute of Health passed the \"Revitalization Act,\" which was meant to counteract a 1977 Food and Drug Administration\\'s guideline prohibiting reproductive-aged women from phase I and early phase II clinical trials. Prior to the Revitalization Act, women were largely excluded from participating in trials using pharmaceutical agents and there was growing concern that the process of drug development did not appropriately evaluate effects in female patients. 3 The systematic exclusion of women from research paralleled a similar exclusion of pediatric patients from clinical trials prior to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children and Pediatrics Research Equity Acts of 1994. These efforts led to a dramatic shift in the culture of pediatric research. 12 Today, the inclusion of women in clinical trials is both expected and commonplace though usually requires that a subject be nonpregnant and/or compliant with effective contraception. 13 However, pregnant women remain habitually excluded from clinical pharmacologic/ therapeutic trials that do not address obstetric conditions. This is due, in large part, to potential risks of teratogenicity weighed against potential medical benefits to the mother. Unfortunately, the \"ethical\" concerns of including pregnant women in research has predominantly trumped maternal benefits in the eyes of society and regulatory bodies. 3 The HIV/AIDS epidemic serves as a singular and excellent example of inclusion of pregnant women in the earliest phases of drug development. 13 However, this was predominantly driven by the potential benefit of reduced vertical transmission to the fetus. 14 Unfortunately, the pattern of excluding pregnant women from clinical trials, even during epidemics, is not new. As an example, seasonal vaccination of pregnant women against influenza has been a recommendation of the WHO since 2005, though was not practiced widely until after the influenza pandemic of 2009. 15 During the global H1N1 pandemic, pregnant women were notably and disproportionately af-fected. Although pregnant women represented only 1% of the U.S. population at the time, they accounted for 5% of U.S. deaths and nearly 10% of hospitalizations related to the virus. 16, 17 Some experts attributed the higher mortality rates, in part, to the use of inadequate doses of oseltamivir. 18 In the aftermath of the pandemic, many researchers urged the scientific community to increase the inclusion of pregnant women in pharmacologic trials, which could potentially benefit that population during future crises. 19 However, in the face of the 2013 Ebola epidemic, pregnant patients were again near universally excluded from treatment studies. Despite recommendations from experts to include pregnant subjects, citing both ethical and medical motives, they were excluded from almost all drug and vaccine trials in affected countries. Reasons for exclusion were most often potential fetal harm, financial and logistical challenges, or none at all. This occurred despite the fact that Ebola was highly lethal for pregnant women and their fetuses. Once again, pregnant women were denied autonomy and their right to decide, and were deprived the same access to potentially lifesaving interventions as other poplations.\" 13 Exclusion from drug-related research is additionally detrimental when it leads to medication use for \"off-label\" indications or at doses not specifically studied in pregnant women. In this setting, the mother and fetus are exposed to potential harms that could have been avoided through rigorous scientific testing. 20 The H1N1 and Ebola crises serve as important historic examples of the danger of excluding pregnant women from important research. At the time of this study, more than 1.3 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed worldwide with nearly 80,000 related deaths. [9] [10] [11] The exclusion of pregnant women is particularly damaging as the SARS-CoV-2 is likely to circulate the globe until a massive and effective vaccination program is implemented. Findings from current research that have excluded pregnant women may not be applicable to the pregnant population. This lack of generaliz-ability is often due to well-known physiologic changes in pregnancy which affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs. The knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of interventions for COVID-19 created by the exclusion of pregnant women may ultimately harm them. While \"ethical\" concerns about potential fetal exposure are often cited, it is in fact unethical to habitually exclude pregnant women from research.',\n",
       " 'Even more concerning, in our review we only identified two drug trials which explicitly included pregnant subjects. At the time of this study, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are among the most promising and studied interventions for COVID-19. However, of the 42 trials we identified which evaluated hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin use, 36 trials explicitly excluded pregnant subjects and 6 failed to address pregnancy in their criteria. This is despite the fact that these medications have been used for decades in pregnancy (for systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria, community-acquired pneumonia, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and chlamydia) with well-established safety profiles.',\n",
       " 'Our study is limited by its descriptive nature and inclusion criteria. Though we primarily included WHO-registered clinical trials to ensure quality and cross-checked the WHO registry against multiple individual registries, there may be relevant trials that were not captured by our analysis. If so, we believe that number to be very small. Additionally, the lack of consistent and effective search functions across each database made some information inaccessible via individual registry query. Furthermore, several trials did not address \"pregnancy\" within the eligibility criteria. It is likely that few pregnant women enrolled in these trials; however, it may be plausible that some of these studies allowed the inclusion of pregnant women. Lastly, we were limited by how quickly the databases changed and acknowledged that the numbers represented by our April 7, 2020 assessment may be different than those in the near future. However, we believe the major strengths of our study to be its contextual importance, systematic and unbiased approach, global inclusivity, and rigorous data filtering and analysis.',\n",
       " 'We are currently facing yet another infectious disease crisis and with so few active trials addressing COVID-19 in pregnancy, we fear that history is repeating itself. The original intentions that underlaid the exclusion of pregnant subjects from research were nonmaleficent. However, in an effort to protect mothers and their fetuses from research-related risks, both will be placed at potentially greater risks related to the use of understudied or off-label treatments. Improving maternal and fetal health requires that we engage pregnant women appropriately in clinical research. Inclusion will allow women to make autonomous and evidence-based decisions, which ultimately protects this scientifically complex (not \"vulnerable\") population through research rather than from it. 21 Pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in COVID-19 clinical trials based on the universal concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent. We call upon professional organizations both in the United States and worldwide to continue to advocate for the timely inclusion of pregnant women in appropriate trials. ',\n",
       " 'The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources. ',\n",
       " \"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to respiratory epithelium through the ACE2 receptor, an endogenous receptor for Angiotensin II (AngII). The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges, as the medical and scientific communities develop new therapies, new diagnostic tests, and new insights into the mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus acts. Studies of coronavirus-receptor interactions have implicated the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate in viral attachment to mammalian cells [1,2]. Recent work on the structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has provided detail about the glycosylations of the spike protein and interactions between the spike protein and carbohydrates [3,4]. Findings suggest potential for both proteincarbohydrate and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between the spike glycoprotein and cell receptors. A galectin-like fold identified in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggests potential binding with chondroitin sulfates, the preferred binding partners of galectins [5]. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated similar effects of heparin and chondroitin sulfates on binding with the spike glycoprotein and on conformational change in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) [6]. Heparin's ability to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 may be related to competition with chondroitin sulfates, since similar conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD follow treatment by chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S,CSA), chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S, CSC), dermatan sulfate (formerly CSB), and chondroitin sulfate D (chondroitin 2,6disulfate), as well as by heparin and heparan sulfate [6]. The galectin-like fold at the N-terminal domain of the spike protein is reported in other coronaviruses to bind with carbohydrates on cell surfaces as an initial step in viral entry [8]. Insertion of amino acids at the cleavage site between the S1/S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has created three potential GalNAc O-glycosylation sites [8], not previously predicted for the bat or pangolin virus [9]. Recent glycoproteomics data identify sulfation at the non-reducing end of HexNAc residues modifying amino acids of the spike protein, most notably at position 74 [10]. Together, these associations reflect the potential impact of the GalNAc moiety, which may be sulfated, on infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. 20.

       " 'In the human aortic smooth muscle cells, exposure to Angiotensin II markedly increased the mRNA expression of CHST11 and CHST15. In contrast, there was no increased expression of TPST1, a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase. The angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan incompletely inhibited the increase in expression. These findings suggest that stimulation of the ACE2 receptor by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may also stimulate expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and increase abundance of the chondroitin sulfates chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate. Accumulation of chondroitin sulfates in the lung is anticipated to impair airflow and oxygenation, leading to secondary decline in ARSB activity due to the requirement for oxygen for post-translational modification and activation of ARSB [13] . Decline in ARSB was shown to increase IL-6 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and to be increased in patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma [14] .

Since IL-6 contributes to cytokine storm in Covid-19, this finding is particularly relevant to the mechanism whereby ARSB decline can contribute to and can accelerate Covid-19 disease. Also, genomic data indicate that mutations affecting ARSB gene expression are associated with unresponsiveness to oxygen therapy in patients with moderate chronic obstructive lung disease [17] , consistent with impaired response to oxygen therapy in Covid-19.',\n",

       " 'The purpose of this paper is to provide a modeling framework for unifying the economy, climate change and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The basic idea is that the continuous growth of consumption activities, capital accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions, which result in climate change, could increase the potential of an epidemic, its contact number or the probability of its arrival. This framework of analysis allows us to think of infectious disease policies in two stages. In the short run, containment policies such as social distancing could help bring down R 0 and stop the epidemic. In the medium and the long run, economic policies aimed at changing consumption patterns and addressing climate change could help to reduce the potential of the epidemic or the probability of its emergence. Clearly there are many ways of extending the basic model. One obvious and very realistic one is to allow for uncertainty. For example, worldwide estimates of R 0 provided by the website Worldometers 12 for COVID-19 range from 1.4 to 4.0, while recent estimates of the same parameter for different areas of England range from 0.72 to 1.29 (Birrell et al. 2020) . Moreover Shaw (2020) indicates that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), originally thought to be in the 2-3 range, may be closer to 5 or 6. Furthermore, stochastic versions of the SIR models in which a Wiener process is attached to the deterministic SIR equations are common (e.g., Tornatore et al. 2005; Barnett et al. 2020b) . It is clear that concepts related to the \"trinity of uncertainty\" (Brock and Hansen 2018) and robust control methods can be applied in such cases.',\n",

Radiologists' manual CT annotations were also available. We first identified 11 clinical variables and 3 types of radiologist-reported features significantly associated with prognosis. Next, focusing on the CT images, we trained deep learning models to automatically segment the scans and reproduce radiologists' annotations. We also built CT image-based deep learning models that predicted future severity better than models based on the radiologists' scan reports. Finally, we showed that including CT scan features alongside the clinical and biological data yielded more accurate predictions than using clinical and biological data alone. These findings show that CT scans provide insightful early predictors of future severity.\",\n",

We also know that during emergency situations, older adults with cognitive or physical impairments face even greater risks for having their autonomy compromised and their human rights violated (United Nations Human Rights -Office of the High Commissioner, 2020).

An important means to avoid confrontational discourse is to refrain from broad age-based categorizations, resulting in sweeping generalizations and a lack of differentiation. Ageism and categorization can be overcome by stressing that we're all in this together rather than emphasizing age as the critical variable, by individualizing communication and interaction, by drawing on personalized rather than generalized messages, and by invoking references to individual people. There is enough research evidence to guide current efforts to identify at-risk individuals in a more refined and effective way, aside from looking only at chronological age.\",\n",

The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by positive results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous reports handled emergency cesarean delivery. Primary symptoms and laboratory data of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant patients. Although the mortality rate is reported to be high after surgery in patients with COVID-19, cesarean delivery was successfully performed under regional anesthesia in most cases and postoperative course was favorable both in the parents and newborns. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in a newborn two hours after delivery from a pregnant woman with COVID-19, based on the increased immunoglobulin levels and deranged liver function, suggesting that its possibility cannot be completely eliminated. Emergency cerebral shunt reconstruction was performed repeatedly in an eight-month-old boy with COVID-19. The tracheal tube was removed in the operating room after surgery and postoperative course was uneventful. All the procedures should be performed in isolated operating rooms with medical staff with level-3 personal protection to ensure the safety of patients and health care providers.',\n",
       " 'The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.',\n",

Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.\",\n",

The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.',\n",

These clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in [2002] [2003] . A few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. Similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. In this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2.

A retrospective cohort study of 34 asymptomatic patients who underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 incubation period reported that 44% required intensive care and 20% died [16] . In addition to potential risks to the patient, the operative team may also be exposed to significant risk of infection.

       " 'A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has rapidly spread around the world since its first reported case in late December of 2019 from Wuhan, China. As of mid-April 2020, this virus has affected more than 180 countries and territories, infecting more than 1,650,000 individuals and causing over 100.000 deaths. With ≈20 million new cases per year globally, cancer affects a significant portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections due to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and anticancer treatments. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, and especially with lung cancer who develop COVID19 experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study developed by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association also documented that lung cancer patients had an increased risk of death, ICU requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and COVID19 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations, findings that could be influenced by the chronic use of anti-PD1 antibodies.',\n",
       " \"The two cases presented here had completed ≥1 year of treatment with an anti-PD1 antibody, intervention that achieved a major response. Neither of the two had previous skin manifestations, nor had they TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, 11 all proteins clearly associated with the cytokine storm generated by COVID19 and were not associated with skin patterns of cutaneous toxicity of pemetrexed. 12 In contrast to the present case reports, patients with COVID19 who received immunotherapy had the highest death rates and chance of developing critical symptoms. 13 This discrepancy may be related to the low number of patients included in the present report; however, our cases did not present major respiratory symptoms, but rather atypical and severe dermatological findings. On the other hand, both patients had low levels of IL6, an important predictor of COVID19-associated fatality. 14 Due to the marked elevation of DD, one of the patients received low-molecular weight heparin, as recently recommended. 15 Marked DD elevation has been recently reported as one of the predictors of mortality in COVID19-infected patients. 16 On the other hand, skin manifestations such as urticarial have been reported in at least 19% of cases. It is worth mentioning that this report was largely based on a cohort of subjects who presented with classical symptoms or were suspected cases. 17 In the absence of respiratory symptoms and previous immunotherapy treatment one could assume that our patient's disease behavior is completely different.\",\n",

Our laboratory currently uses two real time RT-PCR platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Accurate diagnostic testing and subsequent isolation of infected individuals is crucial to mitigating 11 continued transmission. The appeal of the Abbott technology stemmed from our intention to provide rapid and accurate results in our institution, especially for our Emergency Department.\",\n",

In our comparison studies of paired dry nasal swabs and NP swabs in VTM, there were samples testing positive by Abbott platform even when Xpert Xpress N2 Ct values were above 38 which might suggest better sampling using the dry swab in these cases. A study by Zhen et al. has also shown discordant results comparing these two assays against the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay as the reference method (9) . The ID NOW produced 7 false negatives out of 57 positive NP samples, resulting in a PPA of 87.7% compared to 98.3% on Xpert Xpress. Their study however, included a total of 108 NPS transported in VTM, which the manufacturer has now noted decreases the sensitivity of their assay. These authors also determined that the Xpert Xpress had the lowest LOD at 100 viral copies/mL, while the ID NOW had an LOD of 20,000 copies/mL (9), well above the limit of detection stated in the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 package insert (125 genome equivalents /mL).',\n",

Similar to our study, these authors found that the performance of the ID NOW decreased for samples with high Ct values. The study by Rhoads on 96 NPS, however, found a PPA of 94% for ID NOW, compared to 96% with Simplexa Diasorin against a modified CDC assay. This study also showed a correlation with Ct values (R 2 =0.89 -0.91). This would suggest that the sensitivity of both the ID NOW and the Simplexa was reduced as the Ct values exceeded 34.5 (11) .',\n",
       " 'Although the original Abbott package insert had stated that 0.5 to 3.0 mL of viral transport media was acceptable for use in their assay, it also recommended minimizing dilution of the sample as it might result in decreased test sensitivity. The use of dry swabs was recommended by the manufacturer for optimal test performance. Contrary to manufacturer expectations, however, our parallel study showed that the PPA of ID NOW using dry nasal swabs (54.8%), was actually lower than when using NPS in VTM (66.7%) on 15 consecutive positive samples as determined by Xpert Xpress in this study.',\n",
       " 'Interestingly, a recent study by Harrington et al. compared the results of 524 dry nasal swabs tested on the ID NOW with paired nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM run on the Abbott m2000 RT-PCR system (12) . The specimens were submitted from 3 Emergency Departments and 2',\n",

       " 'The literature provides no strong consensus regarding the influence of transport medium and storage conditions on viral load stability. One study looking at differing viral transport media and storage conditions using the Quest and Roche EUA assays showed consistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after 7 days at room temperature, and up to 14 days refrigerated or frozen (13) . The ID NOW package insert also directs clinicians to test swabs as soon as possible after collection, and if not possible, to hold it in its original package for no more than two hours prior to testing or to refrigerate up to 24 hours prior to testing. Outside of inpatient hospital laboratories, such as in outpatient point-of-care testing, independent validation should be performed to assess performance in different settings, including pre-analytic variables. 13 Extrapolating from our results from 101 patient samples, if the ID-NOW assay were to be used as a first step screening, confirmation of over 80% of the tested samples would be required to be confident that the negative results are truly negative. While there was one apparent false-positive result in our parallel study, the overall high PPV (94.4%) and NPA (98.6 %) do support the added value that in 5 -13 minutes a positive result can be interpreted as a true positive. We could not confirm that the apparent false positive result obtained with the Abbott ID NOW was due to sampling variability.',\n",
       " 'Based on our findings, the ID NOW has some utility as a rapid rule-in test for COVID-19 with samples at high viral load; however, we advise caution with its use as a singular rule-out test especially in the setting of samples with lower viral loads. Of the positive samples missed by ID NOW, 13 of the 14 patients had clinical or radiologic evidence of COVID-19. The remaining patient was an asymptomatic patient admitted for an ectopic pregnancy. Currently we cannot assume that patients with low viral load are unable to transmit the virus, as a false negative can significantly affect subsequent clinical and epidemiologic decision-making. It is noteworthy that ID NOW exhibited higher target detection when using NPS in VTM as compared with the dry nasal swabs. Patients having lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their nasopharynx might harbor even lower concentrations in their nasal cavity leading to a lower level of detection by the ID NOW.',\n",
       " 'Reasons for the lower PPA between the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress could be attributed to several factors. The sample population included in our study during the latter part of April 2020, although having a broad spectrum of Xpert Xpress-determined N2 Ct values, did have a significant number of samples with Ct values above 38, which ID NOW did not detect consistently. Differences in viral RNA detection could be related to the differences in NAAT 14 technology used. Although isothermal nucleic acid amplification test (INAAT) is a promising tool, it has been found to have lower sensitivity compared with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (14). Compared to RT-PCR, the molecular chemistry of INAAT is more complex, involving more primers and intricate conformational rearrangements through enzymatic strand displacement, emphasizing the importance of target selection and primer design on performance.',\n",
       " 'Another possible explanation is the potentially poorer performance of the RdRp target used in the Abbott assay compared to other RNA targets as has been described (15, 16) . Recent reports indicate that mutations in the RdRp domain have been emerging (17) . It is unknown at this point if the genomic region targeted by the Abbott assay has changed significantly, as the virus has spread throughout the world.',\n",
       " 'Limitations of our study include relatively small sample size, inability to control for sampling variability and lack of an additional comparator method to discern the discrepancies. In our laboratory, we periodically perform correlation studies between our 2 platforms, Cobas and Cepheid, and results consistently match. Another limitation was transporting the dry swabs specimens to the laboratory for testing rather than testing directly in a point-of-care setting as the Abbott ID NOW platform is intended. Nevertheless, this factor might not have influenced our results, since the samples were handled and tested in ID NOW within the appropriate time and conditions stipulated in the package insert.',\n",
       " 'Overall, our study revealed low PPA of ID NOW when compared with Xpert Xpress irrespective of use of viral transport media or sample type, which raises concerns regarding its suitability as a diagnostic tool. An assay that detects a broad range of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels is highly desirable since it is difficult to control the sample quality and as a consequence, variations in',\n",
       " 'Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract: The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a byproduct or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 °C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (less than 10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign sustainable products.',\n",
       " 'Every member of the society should contribute towards the effort to curb the current (and future) pandemic and the research to develop fully bio-based facemasks will be a step towards the betterment of the quality of life during global health crises. Successful research will facilitate the development of facemasks that could be used by both medical professionals and the public to restrict the transmittance of infectious diseases. The availability of facemasks in societies is particularly important during the surge of novel diseases, like the current COVID-19 when vaccines and anti-viral drugs are things of the future. The provision for the obtainability of the proposed masks will prevent panic, discourage price intensification, and provide potential employment during a pandemic or epidemic. On the other hand, society will be benefited, as the materials used to manufacture the masks will replace petroleum-based plastics, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, since the raw materials for the development of the proposed masks are by-or co-products of industries, it will promote the sustainable use of resources. It will also be beneficial for companies as they will be able to sell their gluten products with higher added value. All the aforementioned aspects will not only aid in stabilising society during an outbreak but also enrich it by enhancing the resiliency to bounce back and thrive after the disaster.',\n",
       " 'In the wake of coronavirus pandemic, facemasks have become a worldwide healthcare essential. During disease outbreaks, it is a daunting task to match the supply and demand for masks. The current masks, that are made of non-renewable resources and are nonbiodegradable, are pernicious towards the environment. The disposal of single-use masks made from petroleum-based polymers creates harmful microplastics in the environment. In a recent study, microplastics have been found in Antarctic sea ice for the first time despite being geographically distant from sizeable plastic pollution sources (Kelly et al., 2020) . Thus, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16 there is an urgent need to increase the disposal efficacy of masks by incorporating raw materials that are inherently innocuous towards the environment and provide superior performance properties, as well. One of the biggest advantages of using gluten plastic is its rapid degradation in outdoor habitats into harmless products. On 27 March 2020, H&M, a major Swedish fashion retailer announced the production of FFP2 category facemasks in',\n",
       " 'China that are to be distributed in hospitals. Since the masks can be made from raw materials readily available in all countries having cereal processing industries with gluten as by-or coproduct, the production can be shifted to domestic facilities.',\n",
       " 'The constituent that can be used to develop the masks is a value-added product, whose utilisation minimises pollution and promotes a greener environment. Pyrolysis or thermochemical conversion is the carbon-neutral (or negative) technique to valorise bio-based resources into carbons. These carbons are extremely resistant to decomposition by chemicals and combustion while being hypo-allergic, as well. Thus, the application of these carbons in developing products (here masks) will concurrently ensure public safety and bestow superior performance properties. On the other hand, although gluten is susceptible to degradation in outdoor environments, they remain intact in less harsh indoor applications. In fact, gluten is very robust in applications that are hydrophobic in nature, e.g. fats and oils. Additionally, the increasing precedence of gluten intolerance and consequently lowered production of wheatbased consumables create motivation for producing plastic products from this industrial sidestream. Furthermore, lanosol, a naturally-occurring compound, that imparts beneficial fire retardancy in gluten also renders it microbe-resistant, which is an important consideration when using gluten for making masks. The entire process of production to distribution of the masks can be made domestic involving minimal transportation that will simultaneously save energy and reduce pollution. The process that can be used to carbonise electrospun gluten nanofibre is often slow pyrolysis, which can potentially offset 2.2 million tons of CO 2 equivalent (Kung et al., 2014) . The resulting carbon from pyrolysis has a considerably lower carbon footprint compared to carbons from petroleum-based sources (Bartocci et al., 2016) . Similarly, gluten has a lower carbon footprint than oil-based polymers and some bio-based polymers (e.g. poly (lactic acid), PLA), as well.',\n",

If the product ends up in the environment via land-fields in countries with less stringent waste-assortment policies, it must be ensured that the degradation products are safer than traditional polymers. Here, gluten represents an advantage, as it would not degrade into microplastics but rather into nitrogen-based components that could even work as a soil conditioner. In conclusion, successful research in mask development will provide societal support in pandemic preparedness by enabling the reduction of infectious disease transmission. Simultaneously, the process of mask development will promote the use of bio-based resources, curtail greenhouse gas emissions and abate the production of harmful microplastics. Thus, this research can contribute to the overcoming of multiple technological and societal challenges on natural resources exploitation in a high-value novel application.',\n",

       " 'Background: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in December 2019, many studies have reported the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the conjunctival sac of patients infected with this virus, with several patients displaying symptoms of viral conjunctivitis. However, to our best knowledge, there is no in-depth report on the course of patients with COVID-19 complicated by relapsing viral conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis. Case presentation: A 53-year-old man confirmed with COVID-19 developed symptoms of viral conjunctivitis in the left eye approximately 10 days after the onset of COVID-19. The results of a nucleic acid test were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival sac of the left eye. The symptoms were relieved 6 days after treatment. However, the patient was subsequently diagnosed with viral keratoconjunctivitis in both eyes 5 days after the symptoms in the left eye were satisfactorily relieved. The disease progressed rapidly, with spot staining observed at the periphery of the corneal epithelium. Although SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in conjunctival secretions, the levels of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6, were increased in both eyes. Both eyes were treated with glucocorticoids, and symptoms were controlled within 5 days. There was no recurrence. Conclusions: In this case report, the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome of a case with COVID-19 complicated by relapsing viral keratoconjunctivitis is described, and the involvement of topical cytokine surge in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as it relates to viral keratoconjunctivitis is reported.',\n",
       " 'In this case report, the diagnosis, disease course, and treatment of a patient with COVID-19 complicated by relapsing viral keratoconjunctivitis are described. The patient developed symptoms of conjunctivitis in the left eye approximately 10 days after the onset of COVID-19. The results of nucleic acid tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival sac of the left eye. However, the results of tests for other common viruses that cause conjunctivitis, such as adenovirus and herpes simplex virus, were all negative. Therefore, we concluded that viral conjunctivitis was related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in this case.',\n",
       " 'In this patient, the main symptom of conjunctivitis were general discomfort and stabbing pain. The typical symptoms of conjunctivitis are bulbar conjunctiva congestion and edema, accompanied by a large quantity of watery secretions and a small quantity of thin viscous secretions, an absence of follicles or pseudo-membranes formation, a lack of the corneal infiltration at the initial stage of infection, no decrease in vision, and no swelling of the lymph nodes near the anterior and posterior ear. At late stages of infection, the symptoms of conjunctivitis were similar with those at early stages, and corneal infection involved peripheral infiltration with epithelial involvement.',\n",
       " 'In this patient, the initial course of conjunctivitis was less than 1 week. The patient consistently wore a mask, although the upper edges of the mask did not fit closely with the nose root. Therefore, it is very likely that infectious respiratory droplets entered the eyes. In addition, the patient had a bad habit of eye rubbing, which led us to speculate that the conjunctival infection was due to external factors. In addition, the results of repeated nucleic acid tests revealed that the virus could not exist in the conjunctival sac for a long time, because it could not be detected in the conjunctival sac after three days, and these results are consistent with those of Chen et al. [10] . However, we could not rule out the presence of residual virus in the conjunctival sac at late stages of the infection, because conjunctival secretion specimens are hard to obtain, quantities are little also, which results in the relatively high specificity and low sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction assays method [13] . The initial progression of conjunctivitis might have been related to the proliferation rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival sac. SARS-CoV-2 infection requires binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [14, 15] . ACE2 is widely expressed by a variety of cells in the human body, and its expression is highest in pulmonary capillary endothelial cells. Another study has also reported ACE2 expression in the human conjunctiva [16] , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might exist in conjunctival secretions. In our patient, conjunctival secretion specimens were repeatedly obtained for virus isolation and culture, but the results were negative, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might not proliferate in the conjunctiva and cause conjunctivitis through direct invasion and destruction.',\n",
       " 'Symptoms of viral keratoconjunctivitis re-appeared in both eyes approximately 5 days after the symptoms in the left eye were satisfactorily relieved. Symptoms were similar to those at early stages of infection, except that disease progressed more rapidly and corneal involvement at the periphery of the cornea was obvious, which was indicative of reactive disease. The results of nucleic acid tests for related viruses in the conjunctival sac were all negative, although these findings might have been caused by a history of topical antiviral drug use. However, the levels of a variety inflammatory factors increased significantly. Therefore, we speculate that the disease was not caused by the direct invasion and destruction of SARS-CoV-2, but rather \"topical cytokine surge\" caused by the autoimmune response. Cytokine and chemokine responses generated against viruses play important roles in mediating crosstalk among the various immune cells and in connecting innate and adaptive immunity. Upon infection, cytokine levels are elevated. Subsequently, inducible inflammatory chemokines direct effector leukocytes to specific tissues, which can upset the immune regulatory network through the constant self-amplification of the positive feedback loop, thereby resulting in cytokine surge [17, 18] . A recent study has reported that the levels of inflammatory factors, such as G-CSF, TNF-α, IL-6, and IP-10, are significantly higher in severely ill COVID-19 patients than those in less severely ill patients, indicating that cytokine surge is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [12] . In infectious immune corneal injuries, bilateral peripheral ulcerative keratitis caused by the herpes simplex virus [19] and bilateral disciform keratitis complicated by adenoviral conjunctivitis [20] due to the induction of inflammatory reactions or immunological responses in the corneal stroma by immune-degrading complexes have also been reported. However, these delayed corneal infiltrations display different clinical signs, and therefore, they are often misdiagnosed. In this patient, the clinical signs of peripheral infiltration with epithelial involvement were similar to those of viral infection; however, this may have been caused by the presence of different immune cells within tissues [21] . Based on the findings of the aforementioned studies, we conclude that viral infections of the eyes, together with increased levels of serum cytokines, tend to associate with corneal infiltration with epithelial involvement or ulceration, resulting in the recruitment of NK cells. On the other hand, viral infections of the eyes tend to associate with corneal infiltration with stromal involvement, CD4+ T cell reactivity [22] , and antigen deposition [23] . In this patient, the serum IL-6 level was two-fold higher than the normal reference range 4 days after hospital discharge. This pro-inflammatory cytokine can diffuse into the conjunctiva, which is rich in blood vessels. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells of the conjunctiva may express inflammatory chemokines, thereby recruiting more inflammatory cells and producing more pro-inflammatory cytokines [24] . As a result, the IL-6 level in the left eye was much higher than that in the right eye, and the IL-6 level in the right eye was similar to that in the blood. Therefore, we conclude that conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2, especially the symptoms at late stages (7 days or later) of the infection, was not due to the local invasion and destruction of the virus; instead, it was due to cytokine surge. The extensive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response caused by the virus in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and corneal limbus eventually resulted in apoptosis of epithelial cells of the peripheral cornea and reactive inflammatory injury rather than apoptosis of epithelial cells of the central cornea. This might explain why the early stages of the infection involved only one eye, whereas cytokine surge involved both eyes.',\n",
       " 'According to the treatment guidelines of epithelial keratitis, glucocorticoids are not usually recommended for punctiform viral epithelial keratitis, because they are believed to promote viral replication. However, in this case, cytokine surge, rather than viral invasion, played a major role. Therefore, glucocorticoid could successfully control symptoms within 5 days, with no recurrence, indicating that hormone therapy was effective, although the symptoms involves corneal epithelial defects. In addition, our findings indicated that cytokine surge might play an important role in the delayed aggravation. In cases of severe corneal inflammation, it might be feasible to inhibit IL-6 production [25] , because this cytokine has important roles in inflammation.',\n",
       " 'Our findings indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could induce viral conjunctivitis through an exogenous mechanism. At early stages of the disease, local invasion and inflammation contributed to the localized nature of the disease, and the disease course did not exceed 1 week. At late stages of the disease, keratoconjunctivitis was aggravated and more widespread, which was related to cytokine surge. Therefore, we conclude that aggressive medicinal intervention, longer and more frequent follow-up, and proper use of topical glucocorticoids can diminish cytokine surge. ',\n",
       " 'With the rapid development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic, there is an ever more urgent need for cheap, fast and reliable tools that can assist physicians in diagnosing COVID-19. Medical imaging such as CT can take a key role in complementing conventional diagnostic tools from molecular biology, and, using deep learning techniques, several automatic systems were demonstrated promising performances using CT or X-ray data. Here, we advocate a more prominent role of point-of-care ultrasound imaging to guide COVID-19 detection. Ultrasound is non-invasive and ubiquitous in medical facilities around the globe. Our contribution is threefold. First, we gather a lung ultrasound (POCUS) dataset consisting of (currently) 1103 images (654 COVID-19, 277 bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. While this dataset was assembled from various online sources and is by no means exhaustive, it was processed specifically to feed deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network (POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular, the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https: //pocovidscreen.org.',\n",
       " 'In the current global pandemic, it is as relevant as hardly ever before that the research community pools its expertise to provide solutions in the near future. Our contribution is the exploration of automatizing COVID-19 detection from lung ultrasound imaging in order to provide a quick assessment of the possibility of a person to be infected with COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'Summary Our first step towards this goal is to release a collection of POCUS images and videos, that were gathered and pre-processed from the referenced sources. The videos are reliably labeled and can be split to generate a dataset of more than a thousand images. We would like to invite researchers to contribute to our database, e.g by pointing to new publications or by making lung ultrasound recordings available. We will constantly update this dataset on: https://github.com/ jannisborn/covid19 _ pocus _ ultrasound.',\n",
       " 'Second, the proposed machine learning model, POCOVID-Net, is intended as a proof-of-concept showing the predictive power of the data, as well as the capabilities of a computer vision model to recognize certain patterns in US data as they appear in COVID-19',\n",
       " 'and pneumonia. Our model, based on a pre-trained convolutional network, was demonstrated a detection accuracy of 89% and a video accuracy of 92%. With a high sensitivity rate of 96% for the COVID-19 class (specificity 79%), we provide evidence that automatic detection of COVID-19 is a promising future endeavour. Despite these encouraging results, readers are reminded that we have presented very preliminary results herein and that we do not claim any diagnostic performance. We also do not consider the detection on US data as a replacement for other test methods and neither as an alternative to extensive training of doctors in the usage of ultrasound for the detection task.',\n",
       " 'Last, with the presented web service we provide an interface that makes our model publicly available to researchers and hospitals around the world. Most importantly, this interface resembles a user-friendly way to contribute lung ultrasound data to our open-access initiative.',\n",
       " 'We believe that POCUS can provide a quick, easy and lowcost method to assess the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hope to have opened a branch for automatic detection of COVID-19 from ultrasound data and envision our method as a first step toward an auxiliary tool that can assist medical doctors. In case of a positive first-line examination, further testing is required for corroboration (e.g. CT scan or RT-PCR). Lung ultrasound may not only take a key role in disease diagnosis, but can be utilized to monitor disease evolution through regular checks performed non-invasively and without the need of relocation.',\n",
       " 'Regarding the patient journey, we envision POCOVID-Net as a preliminary test for random screening and a step toward a complementary test to PCR for COVID-19 suspicions. If a patient is suspected of COVID-19, POCUS could be used to assess the presence of lung lesion that might not have clinical repercussions and thus help detecting people at risk of lung complications which would allow to focus in a more dedicated manner on high-risk patients. For random screening, if POCOVID-Net identifies the patient with COVID-19 lung symptoms, further tests such as RT-PCR, CT-scan and medical check-up should be conducted. As POCUS devices are easily transportable, this test could take place in a primary care center where a physician or technical specialist can go to perform several screenings and avoid contamination in hospitals. It should be noted that with one device, it is possible to perform 4 to 5 lung screenings per hour, taking into account the time needed for installation and cleaning.',\n",
       " 'From the machine learning perspectives several improvements to POCOVID-Net are possible and should be considered, given more data becomes available. First, an evident improvement of the framework would be to perform inference directly on the videos (e.g. temporal CNNs) instead of the current frame based image analysis. While we did not perform this herein explicitly (due to the lack of sufficient data), we report a promising indication, namely that the video classification based on a frame-based majority vote improved the error rate by more than 25% (from 89% to 92% accuracy). Secondly, the benefit of pre-training the network on large image databases could be improved by training the model on (non lung) ultrasound samples instead of using ImageNet, a database of real life objects. This pre-training may help detecting ultrasound specific patterns such as B-Lines. In addition, to exploit the higher availability of CT or X-ray scans, transfer learning strategies could be adopted as in [76, 77] . Furthermore, generative models could help to complement the scarce data about COVID-19 as recently proposed in [78] .',\n",
       " 'We aim to extend the functionality of the website in the future, to further encourage the community effort of researchers, doctors and companies to build a dataset of POCUS images that can leverage the predictive power of automatic detection systems, and thereby also the value of ultrasound imaging for COVID-19 in general. If the approach turns out to be successful, we plan to build an app as suggested in [79] that can enable medical doctors to draw inference from their ultrasound images with unprecedented ease, convenience and speed.',\n",

It assessed the difference in performance between (1) attending 1 instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE at 1 month prior to assessment, and (2) watching training videos for 1 month. Methods: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended 1 instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After 1 month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. Results: Nineteen participants were assessed after 1 month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 3.2 (95% CI: -7.5 to 9.5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor-led group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 5.2 (95% CI: -7.6 to 18). Conclusion: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing scores between instructor-led and video lessons. Video training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " 'The participants who received video training were on average as competent as those who received instructor-led training in person. The video training took only around one-third of the time taken for a training session with an instructor. Therefore, in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, video training might be a resource-efficient way of reaching all relevant personnel without requiring face-to-face training.',\n",
       " 'Although video group participants could watch the videos as many times as they wished and whenever they wanted, it was observed that most of them had watched the video on the assessment day, effectively receiving \"just-in-time\" training. This may have helped their performance and might explain why some participants from the video group performed even better than those who had received training with the instructor 1 month previously. Just-in-time training, whereby information is provided at the time it is needed, has been proven to be effective in teaching other procedures. Jones et al. compared differences in just-intime training between video presentation and small group demonstrations for fit testing N-95 respirator face masks. Fit testing of N-95 is also a part of PPE donning. There were no differences between the groups when assessment was done immediately. 4 However, donning and doffing PPE is much more complicated because it consists of procedures that not only need to be performed correctly, but also in the right sequence, and this is of very high importance. Successful performance by video group participants may have been aided by other factors, such as repetition of the material, not only the possibility to study immediately prior to assessment.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, the West Africa Ebola outbreak (2014-2016) showed how training material can be developed quickly during an emergency response and made available for personnel being deployed to the response, 5 and this study suggests that the rapid development of video materials to provide training in donning and doffing of PPE is worthy of consideration in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak.',\n",
       " 'The study suggests that the PPE donning and doffing competencies of 2 groups were similar where 1 group received live training from an instructor for 1 month before being assessed and the other group watched videos of similar instruction multiple times during the month prior to assessment. The data demonstrate that the video method is time-and resourceeffective when training many participants. In responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, video training in donning and doffing PPE could provide a means of training large numbers of personnel, while minimizing the amount of time and PPE used in training and ensuring social distancing. This study also highlights the need for training videos to be tested to ensure completeness, accuracy, and clarity of actions.',\n",
       " 'Although the focus of this study was not just-in-time training, the observation that most of the video group participants watched the training videos on assessment day suggests that this may have been a beneficial factor in their performance. The effect of different video training schedules and strategies on performance in donning and doffing PPE would be worthy of further study.',\n",
       " \"Background: COVID-19 arise global attention since their first public reporting. Infection prevention and control (IPC) is critical to combat COVID-19, especially at the early stage of pandemic outbreak. This study aimed to measure level of healthcare workers' (HCW') self-reported IPC behaviors with the risk of COVID-19 emerges and increases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals. A structured self-administered questionnaire was delivered to HCWs in selected hospitals. The dependent variables were self-reported IPC behavior compliance; and independent variables were outbreak risk and three intent of infection risk (risk of contact with suspected patients, high-risk department, risk of affected area). Chi-square tests and multivariable negative binomial regression models were employed.\",\n",
       " 'To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the level and key risk factors of IPC self-reported behaviors of HCWs at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, which has practical significance for optimal IPC management among broader populations under the risk of COVID-19 infection.',\n",
       " 'Overall, IPC self-reported behaviors of HCWs were basically satisfactory. HCWs reported good hand hygiene, especially after body fluid exposure and before aseptic procedure. Hand hygiene is recognized globally as a leading measure of IPC, which has been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of common respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses [9, 10] , and it has also been used in respond to SARS [11] [12] [13] , Ebola [14] , [15] , and Plague [16] , etc. HCWs who reported higher hand hygiene during patient care experienced a lower risk of developing SARS [11] . However, the selfreported compliance of hand hygiene before touching patients and after touching patient surroundings was relatively low as showed in previous studies [17] , which may hinder the prevention and control of COVID-19. Besides, given the high transmissibility of the COVID-19 [18] , appropriate patient placement was the primary measure to contain the epidemics, and a high rate of appropriate patient placement was found in this study. The self-reported compliance of mask and glove use when caring confirmed and suspected patients was high, but the self-reported compliance of goggle and gown use were unsatisfactory, which might suggest the insufficient awareness of HCWs on controlling new epidemic. As we know, the main transmitted routes of COVID-19 were droplets and contact [19, 20] , which means that PPE is crucial for controlling COVID-19. The only way to control new life-threatening epidemics at the early stage is optimal IPC behaviors and the maximal protection including masks, gloves, gowns, and eye protection [21] . Thus, the substandard use of goggle and gown would put HCWs at the risk of virus exposure and a significant risk of cross-infection in hospitals. Researchers found that lack of awareness and discomfort of the equipment may hinder PPE use [22] . For example, a survey found that gowns and goggles were tight, foggy and induced intense perspiration and visual acuity, which hindered the care for patient of HCWs [22] . In our study, most HCWs reported to superior when encountering confirmed and suspected patients. According to guidelines, early identification and reporting of an epidemic was important to contain the infection [9] . Reporting can be regarded as the starting point of all subsequent IPC, and 100% reporting rate should be the goal.',\n",
       " 'Not surprising, the outbreak risk promoted selfreported IPC behaviors of HCWs, especially hand hygiene before touching patients, use of goggle and gown. Previous study also found positive changes of hand hygiene and other IPC measures during or one-year after the outbreak of SARS, which means that the outbreak risk has an effective and long-term impact on the practice of IPC measures [23, 24] . As we expected, HCWs in the affected city behave better than unaffected, indicating the increasing risk affects behavior [25] .',\n",
       " 'Contrary to our expected hypothesis, the increased of exposure risk to COVID-19 patients did not promote self-reported IPC behaviors. HCWs who had direct contact with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients even reported worse in some IPC. It may be due to short supply of resources, human deficiency and high workload, which can be explained that the subsequent lack of protective materials and human resources, and timely assistance are in urgent need in combating COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'HCWs in high-risk department reported better behaviors in some IPC than those not. Perhaps because of the daily high incidence and cross transmission of infection in high-risk departments, HCWs usually payed more attention to IPC measures. It enlightens us that daily This work reveals implications to improve care in a highly dynamic, resource limited pandemic setting. Firstly, it may be constructive to equip the core clinical department of COVID-19 with sufficient HCWs, especially male and nurse profession, to relieve the high work load and ensure the higher compliance of IPC measures to reduce the risk of HCAI. Secondly, it is a priority to guarantee the supply of PPE in the core clinical department of COVID-19. Thirdly, the storage of human resources and PPE, the emergent purchase flow in hospital, the encouragement of PPE production and the development of vaccine, etc. are vital in future preparedness.',\n",
       " 'The limitation of this study is that the compliance of IPC behaviors of HCWs may be overestimated, because HCWs may respond to interview questions in a way that they believe is socially acceptable rather than being completely accurate, namely \"Social desirability\" [26] . However, the impact of self-reported behavior on the regression result was hard to determine, comparing to directly observed, because researchers found that the influencing factors were quite different even in the same group and no statistically significant correlations were found between observed and self-reported compliance [27] . To make the self-reported compliance closer to the actual, we devoted all the staffs in research group and trained carefully, to educate HCWs that they should complete the questionnaires based on actual situation.',\n",
       " 'The self-reported IPC behaviors of HCWs significantly improved after COVID-19 outbreak. HCWs who were in the affected area and in high-risk department reported IPC behavior better. But the contact with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients did not promote selfreported IPC behaviors, which may result from higher workload and lack of resources such as gowns. The preparedness system including storage of human resources and PPE in hospital, the emergent purchase flow should be improved. The medical assistance is in urgent need in combating COVID-19, especially human resources with male and nurse profession. ',\n",

Data were obtained from two critically ill Chinese patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. 11 After intravenous administration, in both patients remdesivir showed a peak at the end of infusion and a half-life of 1 h, while GS-441524 reached a peak 1 h after infusion and then remained detectable until the next remdesivir administration. Similar data have been shown in rhesus monkeys after daily intravenous administration of remdesivir, which was rapidly converted into the nucleoside analogue GS-441524 and appeared to reach sustained intracellular concentrations of the active triphosphate form above its EC 90 for SARS-CoV. 5, 8, 14 Furthermore, we found higher GS-441524 plasma concentrations in the patient with renal impairment, indicating that renal excretion was a major route of elimination. There are no specific studies conducted with remdesivir in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment; during the PALM and MEURI protocol no renal or hepatic abnormalities were attributed to remdesivir. 11 Given the benefit-risk calculation in patients with severe SARS-CoV infection and renal impairment, the use of remdesivir should be evaluated. Nevertheless, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the balance between safety and efficacy in these patients. 15 Remdesivir was undetectable in the compartments evaluated, whereas the GS-441524 metabolite was detected in BAS, but at a lower concentration compared with CSF. Compartment differences in drug exposure could be due to different blood supply or protein binding properties (remdesivir has moderate protein binding while GS-441524 exhibits very low protein binding), 9 which are the major factors influencing drug diffusion in cells and tissue. In addition, active efflux by different specific protein transporters in lung and in CNS, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), could potentially be involved. 9, 16, 17 Remdesivir is a substrate for P-gp, while no data are yet available on GS-441524, requiring further studies. Another hypothesis could be the different drug uptake and metabolism in lung cells, where a high number of virus-infected cells are present. 18 Evaluation of the triphosphate form in lung cells is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.',\n",

Confirmed 2019-nCov-infected cases were identified in Dongyang and were treated according to guidelines for the diagnosis of 2019-nCov infection released by the National Health Commission. Information regarding the contacts that the infected people had was collected to determine whether it caused clustered cases. A series of successive nucleic acid examination of feces, oropharyngeal swabs, and sputum was also performed, and the results were analyzed. A total of 19 confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection were identified in Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, China. Five cases showed severe symptoms, and the remaining ones showed mild manifestations. Ten cases infected from two asymptomatic individuals were clustered into two groups. Among 14 cases with consecutive nucleic acid test results, four patients showed positive results in feces after their negative conversion in oropharyngeal swabs. Asymptomatic individuals with the virus could cause 2019-nCov clustered cases, and the clustered cases may differ from sporadic cases on age and length of hospitalization. In addition, nucleic acids in feces last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs.',\n",
       " 'During the Spring Festival, nearly 7000 individuals from Wuhan travelled to Dongyang [22] . Fortunately, only 6 cases from Wuhan tested positive and 13 other cases were infected because they had contacts with the confirmed cases. e people with whom these patients had contact have been traced and their consecutive nucleic acid examination during hospitalization was performed and reported in this study. e initial model predicting the transmission ability of 2019-nCov revealed that the virus has high infectivity, which is supported by our results that two strains caused 10 confirmed cases in our region [19] . When individuals with the virus could not be managed well, it resulted in clustered cases [21, 23, 24] . Without any intervention for prevention or control, the number of incidences would be much higher than that we detected. e accurate identification of individuals with the virus could be achieved by presenting a detailed history of the contacts they had, nucleic acid test, and even CT scan in highly suspected individuals [25] . Once the aforementioned history is complete, an essential intervention including isolation and diagnosis should be performed. Furthermore, the efficient control of transmission is largely dependent on the interventions of the governments, including any forbidden outdoor activity and strict self-isolation, which have been proven to be quite useful in preventing the explosive growth of cases [26, 27] . Daily fever surveillance in the community and nucleic acid testing among suspected individuals provide a timely diagnosis of 2019-nCov infection. e existence of viral RNA in clinical specimens provide the clinicians sufficient evidence to diagnose 2019-nCov [13] . However, negative results have been reported in individuals who show typical pulmonary infection by CT imaging examination. e virus amount in clinical specimens varies along the process of the disease, showing fluctuations between negative and positive results in oropharyngeal swabs in our study. Delay in negative results in feces compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs during convalescence has been reported in a previous study, suggesting that nucleic acids in feces last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs, which is also observed in our study [18] . Indeed, nucleic acids in feces or urine indicate that excrements from confirmed cases should be carefully managed. Virus could be spread through close contact and air-borne droplets from cough or sneeze, while other transmission routes such as fecaloral transmission have not been confirmed [28] . However, nucleic acids in feces specimens last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs in our study and others, indicating that fecal-oral route transmission should be reconsidered and reevaluated in a further study [18] . In this way, the diagnosis and discharge from the hospital based on nucleic acid detection may be modified according to different clinical specimens. e limitation of this study is represented by the limited number of confirmed cases. However, the limited number of cases allows tracing them more easily and the transmission path between the cases can also be analyzed more easily.

A simulation of isothermal evaporation of a thin liquid sample based on the Stefan problem was performed.

Resources essential to monitoring virus transmission have been challenged with a demand for expanded surveillance. The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic Panel uses a real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) consisting of two TaqMan probe and primer sets specific for the 2019-nCoV N gene, which codes for the nucleocapsid structural protein that encapsulates viral RNA, for the qualitative detection of 2019-nCoV viral RNA in respiratory samples. To isolate RNA from respiratory samples, the CDC lists RNA extraction kits from three manufacturers. In anticipation of a limited supply chain of RNA extraction kits and the need for test scalability, we sought to identify alternative RNA extraction methods. Here we show that direct lysis of respiratory samples can be used in place of RNA extraction kits to run the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic assay with the additional benefits of higher throughput, lower cost, faster turnaround and possibly higher senitivity and improved saftey.',\n",

The direct lysis takes less than 20 min to process samples ready for RT-qPCR and can be easily scaled up to a 96-well format and obtain higher throughput.

Additionally, our method starts with only 200 ul of lysis buffer, and 2 ul of direct lysis is 1/100 of the total sample. If we use a smaller swab, which is available, the volume can be lowered further. With the standard method, the sample transport buffer is 3 mL and only 120 ul to 140 ul, depending on the extraction kit, is taken for purification, essentially a 1:15 dilution that can translate into up to a difference of 4 Ct's.\",\n",

We forecast the possible COVID-19 outbreak in one US state (Utah) by applying empirical data from South Korea and Italy, two countries that implemented disparate public health actions. Forecasts were created by aligning the start of the pandemic in Utah with that in South Korea and Italy, getting a short-run forecast based on actual daily rates of spread, and long-run forecast by employing a log-logistic model with four parameters. Applying the South Korea model, the epidemic peak in Utah is 169 cases/day, with epidemic resolution by the end of May. Applying the Italy model, new cases are forecast to exceed 200/day by mid-April, with the potential for 250 new cases a day at the epidemic peak, with the epidemic continuing through the end of August. We identify a 3-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections at outbreak peak, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context.',\n",

These two models in many respects represent a best-case and a worst-case scenario for the COVID-19 pandemic experience in the State of Utah assuming containment measures stay in place. The question is, why are these two models so different and how does Utah (or any other US state) act to ensure that the local experience is one of the best cases possible? There are multiple potential explanations for the variation in case number and disease spread between South Korea and Italy, including differences in demographic characteristics (e.g., Italy has the second-oldest population in the world) [45] or even different viral strains [46] . However, one likely factor is the different approaches to outbreak management between the two countries. Unlike demographic characteristics or rapidly evolving viral strains, the public health response is something that Utah and other localities anticipating the virus can control.',\n",
       " 'The containment strategy used in South Korea was based on widespread testing (case tracking), isolation, contact tracing, as well as a combination of social distancing, travel restrictions, and enforced quarantine. This approach was also successfully deployed in Hong Kong and Singapore in order to rapidly contain outbreaks [47] . The realization that many of the early cases in South Korea were associated with a single organization likely facilitated an initially focused intense response which was then broadened throughout the country. This containment strategy works best in relatively small populations with good public health and healthcare infrastructure, where administering and analyzing tests and contact tracing are feasible. Italy\\'s response was largely a \"lockdown\" strategy, which included mandatory quarantine, shelter-in-place orders or recommendations, bans on public gatherings, and closure of businesses. The success of this strategy depends on maintaining the isolation of individuals -whether self-imposed or enforced -and can be highly variable across geographic jurisdictions. Further, this approach typically results in additional waves of cases as restrictions are lifted, as has been seen in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. These locations have reintroduced restrictions, in order to address the upswing in cases subsequent to relaxing the initial restrictions [47] . Thus, the lockdown strategy is most beneficial in terms of slowing the epidemic but, alone, does not lead to containment. In Utah, adequate containment of viral spread, seen to be beneficial elsewhere through mandatory shelter-in-place orders, has not been realized, likely due to the inconsistency of such orders. Further, Utah was slow to gain access to and implement wide-spread testing, possibly creating an exacerbation of community spread, only beginning large-scale testing on 19 March.',\n",

The geographic isolation of South Korea limits the generalizability of this country's experience to the United States. Entry into South Korea via a land border is extremely limited, as the only land border is the Demilitarized Zone with North Korea. South Korea is well connected to the rest of the world via air travel, but the number of airports with an international service is relatively small. As it is a peninsula, there is a long oceanic border, but South Korea does not have close neighbors by sea. This geographic isolation may be an important, non-modifiable factor explaining some of the differences in the containment and control of the viral outbreak between South Korea and other countries. Italy is also a peninsula, but it is in the heart of Europe with many connections to other countries by land, air, and sea. The geographic situation for Italy is more similar to most U.S. states than the South Korean context. As a land-locked state which also serves as a transportation hub in the Intermountain West, Utah's geography and unlimited restriction on interstate transportation add to challenges associated with the movement of individuals. Additionally, the stark inconsistency of prevention measures across municipalities and jurisdictions within the state further complicate the success rates of various policies. For example, Salt Lake City, the state's capitol and largest city, issued a stay-in-place proclamation. The proclamation, however, applies only to those living within the city's political boundaries, and jurisdiction of the rule does not extend to those who travel to the city for work or other reasons.\",\n",
       " 'The potential impact of these two models on Utah are substantially different. With the South Korea model, Utah will have a pandemic peak around the beginning of April, with a likely maximum of 169 new cases per day and a cumulative total of around 3245 cases. With the Italy model, Utah would peak the second week of April with a maximum of around 250 new cases per day and a cumulative total of upwards of 9857 cases over the six months of the pandemic. In reviewing the difference in strategies, testing figures heavily into the equation. South Korea sought out and tested those who were potentially exposed and used the public health tools of quarantine and isolation. Italy depended primarily on the public health tools of extreme social distancing and testing of symptomatic cases only. This would suggest that for Utah to have an experience closer to South Korea, extensive and coordinated testing would be in order. The testing should focus primarily on contacts of cases with quarantine of exposed individuals and isolation of those testing positive.',\n",
       " 'While the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was in China, we decided to use other countries as a reference for the two extremes in our modeling for several reasons. First, the stability of the initial numbers from China were questionable given that it was not clear then that a new pandemic has been emerging. Second, we believe that COVID-19 behaves in a self-similar fashion geospatially in its spread trajectory or growth with the understanding that the size of the exposed population and the timing of containment measures at the beginning of the spread could modify the peak numbers and cumulative numbers of the pandemic. In fact, a recent study has shown that the number of infected people with time in the most impacted and unprepared countries in urban settings, indeed exhibit an asymptotic power law behavior confirming the self-similar property or fractal time growth of the COVID-19 pandemic [48] . Thus, there is no loss of generality in choosing Italy over China as one of the extremes in our modeling.',\n",
       " 'The present COVID-19 pandemic is a new and rapidly evolving outbreak which has been responded to and contained to varying degrees by countries around the world. While a number of non-modifiable factors likely explain the success, or lack thereof, of jurisdictional mitigation and containment efforts, it is highly likely that differences in public health actions also play a significant role, allowing communities anticipating the virus to learn and adapt from action plans that have proven effective. In the current study, we identify a three-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context. These variations, and the public health, morbidity, and mortality impacts they connote, both describe the possible distribution of outcomes for one U.S. state, as well as provide a cautionary warning about which public health actions must be urgently emulated and adapted to minimize the impact of the epidemic, and which are likely to result in local catastrophe.

       " 'To investigate the value of initial CT quantitative analysis of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and total lesion volume and its relationship with clinical features for assessing the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 . Materials and Methods: A total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed from January 23, 2020 to February 19, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: severe group (n = 23) and non-severe group (n = 61). Clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and CT findings on admission were analyzed. CT quantitative parameters, including GGO, consolidation, total lesion score, percentage GGO, and percentage consolidation (both relative to total lesion volume) were calculated. Relationships between the CT findings and laboratory data were estimated. Finally, a discrimination model was established to assess the severity of COVID-19. Results: Patients in the severe group had higher baseline neutrophil percentage, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin levels, and lower baseline lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage (p < 0.001). The severe group also had higher GGO score (p < 0.001), consolidation score (p < 0.001), total lesion score (p < 0.001), and percentage consolidation (p = 0.002), but had a lower percentage GGO (p = 0.008). These CT quantitative parameters were significantly correlated with laboratory inflammatory marker levels, including neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, hs-CRP level, and procalcitonin level (p < 0.05). The total lesion score demonstrated the best performance when the data cut-off was 8.2%. Furthermore, the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 93.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 86.8-100%), 91.3% (CI: 69.6-100%), and 91.8% (CI: 23.0-98.4%), respectively. Conclusion: CT quantitative parameters showed strong correlations with laboratory inflammatory markers, suggesting that CT quantitative analysis might be an effective and important method for assessing the severity of COVID-19, and may provide additional guidance for planning clinical treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'In the present study, GGO and consolidation components within the infection region of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were quantitatively assessed according to lesion density, to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. While this method was similar to that reported previously (18) which was based on visual, semi-quantitative, evaluation of the disease (19) (20) (21) , the current quantitative analysis of GGO, consolidation, and total lesion volume can more accurately assess pulmonary inflammation. Based on the retrospective assessment of initial CT and clinical characteristics, it was found that the quantitative parameters of lung CT were significantly different for patients with severe COVID-19, and that these parameters were significantly correlated with laboratory inflammatory markers. The results of the present study suggest that CT quantitative analysis can be helpful in assessing the severity of COVID-19 and may provide further guidance for planning clinical treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'The average age of the severe group was greater than that of the non-severe group, which was consistent with the findings of previous research (6, 22) . However, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the presence of comorbidities or main initial symptoms on admission, which is in contrast to previous findings (22) . This may be due to the sample selection bias. Inflammation of the deep airways and alveoli was significantly heavier in the severe group, as demonstrated by higher baseline neutrophil percentage, hs-CRP level, and procalcitonin level, and lower lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage. This finding was in line with that of a study conducted on the clinical course and outcomes of critical patients with COVID-19 (23) . In this study, 80% of critical patients had lymphopenia, and lymphocytopenia was a prominent feature of critical patients with SARS-CoV infection due to damage to the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocytes by SARS-CoV viral particles, causing their destruction (24) .',\n",
       " 'Initial CT revealed that lesions commonly involved multiple lobes with peripheral or mixed peripheral and central distribution, crazy-paving sign, and air bronchogram, and these markers were more common in the severe group. This indicates that the diversity of the initial lesions in severe patients was not solely due to GGO lesion caused by exudation, but also due to a large number of consolidations. This present study finding was consistent kjronline.org with that of a previous report, in which severe patients had a larger lung lesion involvement (i.e., total lesion CT score) than that in non-severe patients (25) . The total lesion score on CT quantitatively represents the percentage of lung parenchyma, demonstrating evidence of abnormalities as a whole and assesses of the total extent of the disease. A significant correlation was found between the extent of disease assessed on chest CT and the impairment in gas exchange as well as the severity of dyspnea (18) . In addition, patients in the severe group demonstrated an increase in the consolidation component of lesions, indicating extension of the disease course and deterioration of the lesion, which were correlated to the pathological characteristics of severe patients. A recent pathological study revealed that patients with severe COVID-19 had total lung injury (26) , including alveolar edema with bleeding, alveolar inflammation with epithelial inflammatory damage, and bronchiolitis, which was similar to that in patients with SARS.',\n",
       " 'The present study revealed that the total lesion score, GGO score, consolidation score, percentage GGO (relative to total lesion volume), and percentage consolidation (relative to total lesion volume) were negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage. Lymphopenia is the common abnormal laboratory result that occurs due to the progression of COVID-19 (6, 27) . The damage to lymphocytes may be an important factor leading to symptom exacerbations in patients with COVID-19. A previous study suggested that a decrease in T-lymphocyte count indicates that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) virus has consumed many immune cells (28) , inhibited the cellular immune function, and reduced these even further in patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, the present study also revealed significant positive correlations between CT quantitative parameters and neutrophil percentage, hs-CRP levels, and procalcitonin levels. These results were consistent with those of another report (25) . Neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein levels may be correlated to the cytokine storm induced by viral infection (6) and increased procalcitonin level may be due to secondary bacterial infection (27) . These results revealed that the extent of inflammatory involvement on lung CT was consistent with the changes in laboratory inflammatory markers, which further indicates that CT could have the potential to assess the severity of pulmonary inflammation and lung damage due to COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'The early identification of patients and assessment of the severity of COVID-19 may guide clinical treatment options and reduce the mortality rate. In the present study, a discrimination model was established to diagnose and evaluate the severity of COVID-19 according to CT quantitative parameters. The total lesion score demonstrated the best performance, and the AUC was 0.94 when the data cut-off was 8.2%. The results revealed that a total lesion score of 8.2% indicated disease course extension and lesion deterioration.',\n",
       " 'Although the investigators initially investigated the value of CT quantitative parameters and their correlation with laboratory examination results for assessing the severity of COVID-19, there were several limitations. First, the sample size was too small, especially in the severe group, and sample selection bias may have occurred. Second, there was a lack of histopathological support in all cases, and the correlation between CT features and histopathological manifestations requires further study. Third, since this study was completed within approximately 40 days since the outbreak occurred, more observations are required to understand the pathophysiological changes of the disease. Finally, there was no further analysis of the longitudinal pattern of the disease; however, this will be covered in our future research.',\n",
       " 'In summary, this study revealed that CT quantitative parameters were correlated with laboratory inflammatory markers, and that the total lesion score on CT demonstrated the best performance for assessing the severity of COVID-19. These results suggest that CT quantitative analysis could play a significant role in assessing the severity of COVID-19, which could be used as an important disease indicator, and help in guiding the clinical treatment and contribute to disease prognosis.

We believe the significant reduction in current stroke admissions might be related to fewer people going to the Emergency Department due to fear of being infected and in response to the measures previously described. This might make sense in minor non-disabling strokes. However, it is hard to assume that a severely disabling stroke, such as those secondary to large-vessel occlusion, did not come to the hospital, even if it was late for reperfusion treatments. Having said that, although there was a decrease in the number of patients who received reperfusion therapies per week, we did not find changes in the proportion of IVT and EVT patients in our region, if we compared it with the total amount of ischaemic strokes for each period.

       " 'With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemia, routine clinical work was immediately, deeply, and sustainably impacted in Germany and worldwide. The infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources, including the necessary staff. In parallel, routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured. This challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care. In order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety, continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured. Intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies. In parallel, it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients. This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research. Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) -a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellenceduring the COVID-19 crisis. We aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future.',\n",

How many patients will need mechanical ventilation or how that in reality will affect the staff resources of all other departments is so far not predictable and may also be of different extent in different federal regions. However, in our opinion, it is already clear that cancer care will be significantly impacted by the current pandemia. Although we are convinced that cancer care can still be provided for all patients in need, potential disadvantages for individual patients despite SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and Cancer 7 Oncol Res Treat DOI: 10.1159/000508272 critical benefit-risk assessments and interdisciplinary discussions cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, we have to anticipate that due to the current changes in social behavior and resources, cancer diagnosis will be delayed, and more patients will be diagnosed in the near future at a more advanced stage. The unrestricted access for patients to the innovative technologies in oncology, to clinical trials, second opinions, and center-specific treatments will not be kept up as before the COVID-19 pandemia. The temporary shutdown in translational research will lead to a delay in relevant and groundbreaking findings, which will extend far beyond the time of the pandemia: Fundamental experiments will be delayed, grant applications will not be submitted in time, and manuscripts will potentially not be completed. In parallel, relevant third-party funding will be redirected towards funding to unravel the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Cancellation of conventions and meetings will negatively impact the scientific exchange in the expert community and will lead to a lack in interdisciplinary and multinational networks. High-ranked political initiatives, such as the National Decade against Cancer in Germany or the European Beating Cancer Plan, are in danger of significant slowdown.

This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients' mortality. Methods: 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 93% or PaO2/FiO2<=300 mmHg. Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls. On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care. Results: Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered. The respiratory function resulted improved in 64.8% of the observations in tocilizumab patients who were still hospitalized, whereas 100% of controls worsened and needed mechanical ventilation.

Also, it has been hypothesized that the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV itself could enhance the IL-6 expression [14] . The findings of the current retrospective observational study support the presence of similar mechanisms also in COVID-19 pneumonia, as reported in previous research [15] . It is worth noting that patients included in this study were treated relatively early in the course of their respiratory failure -as shown by the fact that none of them needed mechanical ventilation at admission to the hospital-with the aim to reduce the excessive immune response associated with the development of lung damage, without abolishing the immune response toward the virus.\",\n",

       " 'The implementation of large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serological testing on a population level is heavily debated by governments and national regulators to adopt restriction regulations to current demands in countries where the number of infections is decreasing. Beside of supplementing primary diagnosis [18] , monitoring of immune response to vaccine candidates and evaluation of immunity duration [10] , seroepidemiologic studies represent the main application area of immunoassays. Here, serological tests promise to provide the greatest benefit as they may allow accurately assessing infection prevalence and establishing indicators of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In this screening situation, oligo-or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will represent the majority of cases.',\n",
       " 'For evaluation of test performance, the study cohort should represent the intended test population. This has not been adequately addressed so far, as the majority of published studies comparing different immunoassays were performed on hospitalized patients with ongoing infection [19] [20] [21] [22] . This might affect the diagnostic test performance on two ways. First, the time of blood-draw after symptom onset substantially impacts the number of positive test results as reliable test results for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing can be obtained with a median of 14 days after symptom onset and sometimes with a delay of several weeks [13, 17, 18, [23] [24] [25] . Second, it has been shown that the IgG level of hospitalized patients is enhanced compared to a moderate to absent IgG immune response in mildly affected individuals [11, 23, 26, 27] . Therefore, our study cohort included patients after hospitalization or end of home quarantine representing the different severity of the disease course.',\n",

Most importantly, the diagnostic accuracy for all test systems was 100% using quality control samples.',\n",
       " 'To the best of the author´s knowledge, this is the first study so far addressing systematically the impact of specimen type on the test performance of different immunoassays. For screening purposes or seroepidemiological studies, the available blood specimen types may vary. Often, only lithium heparin plasma is available as the most common residual material from patient samples archived in the laboratory. According to manufacturer´s instruction of Euroimmun and Roche, serum and lithium-heparin plasma can be used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and no different cut-offs have to be used for interpretation of test results. In contrast, the Epitope assay is restricted to serum as testing material. Our analysis of 20 matching serum and plasma samples revealed a high level of concordance between both testing modalities for assays from Euroimmun and Epitope by linear regression, Passing Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis demonstrating the interchangeability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in both blood matrices (r 2 =0.97 and r 2 =0.91). However, based on qualitative results the overall agreement was 100% for the Epitope test and 90-95% for the immunoassay from Euroimmun.',\n",
       " 'Statistical evaluation of the Roche Elecsys assay demonstrated significantly higher values measured in plasma than in serum samples and correlation analysis proved that plasma-and serum-based testing are no interchangeable. In this context it is important to mention that all assays were performed with the same lot number and no technical problems from the manufacturer have been reported for this lot. Comparable results have been reported for neutralization antibody tests (NAT) [10] . Although no false-positive or false-negative qualitative result was noted for the Roche test, this might be the case for samples near the assays cut-off. Hence, our results for at least two FDA EUA approved assays demonstrate that optimal cut-offs and assay performance should be separately assessed for each testing material.',\n",
       " 'To estimate test performance, manufacturers refer to test sensitivity and specificity or positive and negative percent agreement indicating that a non-reference standard was used for test evaluation. In case of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG testing, the respective manufacturer´s information is summarized by the Center for Health Security of Johns Hopkins University [13] . Here, for all three immunoassays included in this study a sensitivity of 100% is reported if patients are tested from 14 days after diagnosis onwards. The specificity is indicated by 100% for the tests from Euroimmun and Epitope diagnostics and 99.81% for the Roche assay. In our study, we compared the diagnostic test performance of these immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on a panel of 51 serum samples including 26 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 25 controls. Our analysis revealed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, 96.2-100% and 100% with a respective diagnostic specificity of 100%, 100% and 84-86% for the immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics. In total, 84-96 % of samples were correctly classified as negative and 92.3-95.2% as positive. For test sensitivity, these findings are clearly below manufacturer´s specifications. One explanation might be that we preferentially included patients with subclinical infections or a mild course of disease representing the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections and for whom the IgG immune response is reported to be moderate [10, 23, [26] [27] [28] . In this context it is worth mentioning that one sample was classified as positive by two assays in agreement with the qRT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, but was found negative by the Roche test. This underscores that, as expected, the high specificity of the Elecsys assay leads to a reduction in test sensitivity to a certain extent.',\n",
       " 'Especially as no borderline results are reported by the Elecsys assay, patients with COIs marginally below the cut-off might need to be reevaluated after a certain time period to reduce false-negative test results. Egger et al. demonstrated that the diagnostic sensitivity strongly depends on time from symptom onset with a sensitivity ranging between 100% [29] and 89.36% [30] from day 15 onwards for the Elecsys test. Nevertheless, the false negative results revealed in our study are obtained 26 and 45 days after confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, the diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3% revealed in our study is in line with those reported by others [29] [30] [31] . Comparable, findings for the assays from Euroimmun and Epitope diagnostics are in agreement with or even better than those reported in other studies [20] [21] [22] .',\n",
       " 'The decision whether an assay is suitable for clinical use or which test might be preferred depends on the intended testing purpose. For seroepidemiologic studies and screening purposes, the identification of affected individuals is usually based on a screening test with high diagnostic sensitivity and a confirmatory test with high specificity. In case of anti-SARS-CoV-2, such a confirmatory test could be a neutralizing antibody test (NAT). However, these tests are time-consuming with a turn-around-time of 3-5 days [13] , require a biosafety level-3 laboratory and thus cannot be performed on a broad extent or for population-based studies.',\n",
       " 'Hence, the estimation of the infection prevalence relies on serological tests without further confirmatory test and thus priority must be given to test specificity over sensitivity. Arguments for prioritizing test specificity include more far-reaching consequences in case of a false positive test result. Second, due to currently low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the population that is estimated at 0.32% in the United States [32] , only with a test specificity approaching 100% an acceptable positive predictive value can be obtained [17, 21, 32] . Our study revealed that these requirements are fulfilled by the immunoassays from Euroimmun and Roche. However, as our study is limited by sample size further large-scale studies are warranted to address the specificity of the different assays in different subpopulations for whom a high level of test interference with immunoassays is reported, e.g. for patients suffering from chronic diseases. Another possibility to increase the positive predictive value of serological tests is to monitor individuals with a positive antibody test and only consider them positive in case of seroconversion defined as class-switch from IgM to IgG or a more than 4fold increased IgG titer formerly for SARS [33, 34] .',\n",
       " 'Finally, it has to be mentioned that antibody detection might be due to cross reactivity with other coronaviruses [26] and even if specific does not necessarily equate with protective immunity [17, 35] . It remains to be elucidated whether antibodies against nucleocapsid or spike protein will prove superior in assessing immunity. True immunity studies will require direct comparison with NAT [17] .',\n",
       " 'In summary, our study demonstrated a high specificity for both FDA EUA approved immunoassays and a good diagnostic sensitivity. Overall, these results were superior to the non-FDA EUA declared test included. This is underlining the suitability of the immunoassays from Roche and Euroimmun for seroepidemiologic studies and screening purposes. In case of positive results, either a follow-up of patient in order to confirm results by seroconversion or a NAT might be necessary. However, comparing different blood specimens significantly different results were obtained either on quantitative or qualitative evaluation.

Interestingly, the proportion of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases was lower in the \"atypical appearance\" category (2.8% to 5.3%) than in the \"negative for pneumonia\" category (20% to 25%). This can be explained by the facts that this study included symptomatic patients (i.e. fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) and that the \"atypical appearance\" category also included abnormalities consistent with another lung disease (not COVID-19). Therefore, the prevalence of diseases other than COVID-19 (e.g., bacterial lobar pneumonia, bronchial and bronchiolar infections, and typical cardiogenic pulmonary edema) was considerably higher in the \"atypical appearance\" category than in the \"negative for pneumonia\" category, whereas the opposite was true for the prevalence of COVID-19 between these two categories.

As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a database of ∼4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including three natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit a large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 forms H-bonds to all of the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to ∼2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

       " 'Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.',\n",

       " \"To the best of our knowledge, the current study is one of the few to present data on the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19. The overall prevalence of psychological distress among the 126 COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence is 54.8%, with 31%, 22.2%, and 38.1% meeting the criteria for excessive stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Previous studies worldwide indicated the incidence of mental disorders after major disasters was from 10% to 20% [6] [7] [8] 19 . Our results are much higher than that. The possible reasons are speculated as follows. First, the features of COVID-19, being highly contagious 1,20 , lack of antiviral drugs with definite efficacy 20 and the possibility of recurrence of the positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in convalescence 9,10 , lead to widespread fears, horrors, and worries. Second, with the popularization of internet and smart-phones, people are overwhelmed with all kinds of information, resulting in more misunderstandings about the disease, excessive worries, and unnecessary fears. A recent study found that heavy media use increases the incidence of PTSD and depression in social unrest 21 . Third, the isolation from family members and friends brings out helplessness and loneliness 2 . Idleness during the isolation period is likely to lead to an increase in negative mood states, as well as worry about one's physical health 2 . Fourth, as indicated by the burden hypothesis 22 , the COVID-19 epidemic affects employment and incomes of most families, which adds to psychological distress. Fifth, remorse and worries about the infection of family members and close relatives add to more passive emotions, strongly supported by the significant associations between the presence of family members or close relatives and all kinds of psychological symptoms indicated by the current study. Last, with respect to telephone interviews, a majority of the survivors found that they were afraid of being stigmatized because they were infected and that they were overwhelmed with the idea they may be henceforth treated differently. Apart from the dramatically high incidence of short-term psychological problems indicated by the current study, data from previous studies on SARS about one-year psychological distress 8 indicated that survivors may develop more persistent psychological disorders with time after recovering from infectious diseases. Therefore, we suggested that all COVID-19 survivors should be screened for stress disorder, anxiety, and depression regularly to identify those with psychological distress for timely intervention.\",\n",
       " \"To help identify the COVID-19 survivors at-high-risk for psychological problems, the current study suggested several predictors significantly associated with the development of psychological distress. The presence of infected family members or close relatives was associated with more symptoms of stress, anxiety as well as depression, wherein, the strength of association with stress symptoms was weak, while with depression and anxiety symptoms were strong. Concerns about the health problems of infected family members and guilt of being a source of infection lead to deterioration of mood, adding to more depression and anxiety symptoms, which may degrade and vanish as loved ones recover, or deteriorate and persist otherwise. Post-infection physical discomfort had minor associations with stress and depression symptoms, but it showed a high predictive value for more severe anxiety symptoms. As physical discomforts may be the cause as well as the effect of passive emotions, we failed to distinguish the confounding effects. Good social support was strongly associated with less severe stress symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression in the current study, consistent with the results found by previous studies that good social support helps to alleviate the emotional stress associated with traumatic events 23, 24 . Being female was moderately related to more severe stress symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, corresponding to the findings of previous studies about SARS related psychological distress, which indicated that being female leads to more vulnerability to stress events 8 . Retirement was found to be associated with less severe stress symptoms, which may be explained by the burden hypothesis that those who had not retired are at higher risk for psychological distress because of greater social and financial responsibilities 22 . The association between older age and psychological distress and the confounding effects between retirement and older age will be discussed later. The current study found no significant associations between psychological distress and the survivors' educational background, medical history including history of psychiatric disorders as well as overall medical parameters of COVID-19. On one hand, it may be that the huge social-psycho impact brought by the COVID-19 epidemic exceeds the decisive role of the disease itself. On the other hand, the relevant information was collected by the survivors' recall and dictation, which may lead to information inaccuracy, especially history of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the subjects included in the current study all completed the online questionnaire by themselves, which indicates that they all had access to online sources of information, thus attenuating the impact of educational background.\",\n",
       " \"The current study also contributes to knowledge of geriatric psychiatry, specifically about older survivors' psychological response to infectious diseases. Although the relationship between older age and PTSD-SS scores was overshadowed by that of retirement and PTSD-SS scores in Stepwise Regression analysis, Mann-Whitney test suggested that older COVID-19 survivors were about less than twice as likely to develop excessive stress symptoms. Moreover, older age was found to be strongly related to less severe hyperarousal symptoms and emotional symptoms of depression, and minorly associated with less severe anxiety symptoms. No significant difference was found between older COVID-19 survivors and the younger survivors for depression symptoms. Our findings about stress response corresponds to a prior study 25 that found people over 60 years old had significantly fewer PTSD symptoms than all other age groups. Community-based surveys also confirmed that PTSD symptoms were less prevalent among the older population 26 . A meta-analysis concerning post human induced disasters came to the same conclusion as ours that older adults (with the age above 65) were about less than twice as likely to experience PTSD symptoms, while finding no significant difference between older adults and younger adults for depression 27 . Our finding, that, compared with survivors of other ages, older COVID-19 survivors reported fewer emotional symptoms and fewer anxiety symptoms, indicates that the older adults had less emotional reactivity to the infection, which may protect them from excessive stress response. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies and several theories may explain why 21, 22, 28, 29 . Prior experiences, as cognitive theory suggested, make it less likely for the older adults to incorporate traumatic events as a central part of their identity than the younger population 28 , and, as inoculation hypothesis suggested, may result in decreased emotional reactivity to subsequent exposure among the older adults 21 . Besides, maturation helps the older adults develop an adaptive coping style with greater resilience to psychological distress than the younger adults 29 . According to the burden hypothesis, older adults bear fewer social and financial responsibilities during the traumatic events than the younger adults 22 . It may also explain why the retired COVID-19 survivors suffer less psychological distress than the ones who had not in the current study. Most of the older survivors belong to the retirement group. Older age and retirement may have a mutual influence on psychological response. However, we failed to eliminate the confounding effects between older age and retirement as a result of a small sample size in the stratified analysis.\",\n",
       " \"There are a few limitations of this study. Online questionnaire surveys screened out those survivors who did not know how to use smartphones, failing to get psychological data from those with low levels of education or very old individuals and who were inaccessible to online information. The participants were COVID-19 patients cured and under quarantine in the hospital designated by the government in Shenzhen city, where medical sources and daily necessities were abundant. In some countries people have been forced to quarantine in their own homes rather than in government designated center, which may have significant impact on the COVID-19 survivors' mental well being. Therefore, the present findings may not be readily generalized to all COVID-19 survivors. Besides, the current study was conducted at an early stage of recovery. Psychological distress may improve with time as the survivors return to normal routines or as their infected family members get better. Stress response symptoms may be over-reported in the present study, especially in young individuals who are concerned about returning to work. Such findings should be further substantiated by the administration of outpatient follow-ups, after quarantine, for PTSD and mood disorder to differentiate it from other diagnoses such as adjustment disorders. There is also limitation in statistical analysis. The number of statistical tests was huge and type I error was inflated in the current study. In this retrospective study, small number of participants may limit the power of finding significant relationships between predictor variables and psychological distress not indicated by the current study.\",\n",
       " \"The current study presents data on the short-term mental health consequences of COVID-19, suggesting that COVID-19 survivors during early convalescence suffer a high incidence of psychological distress, including excessive stress, anxiety and depressive moods, which may improve after quarantine. However, data from previous studies of one-year SARS related psychological distress 8 indicated that survivors may develop more persistent psychological disorders with time after recovering from infectious diseases. Therefore, we suggested all COVID-19 survivors, both undergoing quarantine and after quarantine, should be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. Predictors significantly associated with COVID-19 related psychological distress suggested by the study may help identify those at-high-risk for timely interventions. Besides, the current study contributed to accumulating data on geriatric psychiatry, specifically about older adults' psychological responses to infectious diseases, indicating that older COVID-19 survivors have less emotional reactivity to infection, fewer anxiety symptoms and fewer stress reaction symptoms than younger survivors.\",\n",

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing \"trained\" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in COVID-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with MMR in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to COVID-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with MMR in high-risk populations may provide a \"low-risk-high-reward\" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " \"Background: Compared to adults, there are relatively few studies on COVID-19 infection in children, and even less focusing on the unique features of COVID-19 in children in terms of laboratory findings, locations of computerized tomography (CT) lesions, and the role of CT in evaluating clinical recovery.

Our results are consistent with these previous reports. For example, the clinical symptoms from our study versus the recent study with the most pediatric patients are similar [10] : fever, 64% versus 41.5%; cough, 44% versus 48.5%; diarrhea, 6% versus 8.8%; and fatigue, 4% versus 7.6%.

Ground-glass opacities distributed along the bronchovascular bundle (thin green arrow). 2B Bilateral ground-glass opacities with vascular thickening (arrowheads) in the subpleural area from a 13-year-old boy with a fever and a cough. 2C Local patchy shadowing (green arrow) image from a 6 month-old girl with a fever and a cough. 2D Lesions in the lower lobe of both lungs (green arrows) on chest CT obtained from a 15-year-old boy with a fever and a cough published ones [15, [22] [23] [24] . For example, our results for lymphopenia compared to Zheng et al. are 16% versus 40% [22] . Their normal reference values for lymphocytes were (2.1-5.7) × 10 9 /L (< 3 years), (1.4-4.2) × 10 9 /L (4-6 years), and (1.1-3.2) × 10 9 /L (≥ 6 years). To date, this is the only paper that has explicitly listed the normal ranges for children of different age ranges [22] . Thus, the differences between ours and those in the literature are most likely due to different normal ranges used for children of different ages or the small number of children who participated in their studies.',\n",
       " 'Like clinical symptoms, the laboratory findings in COVID-19-positive pediatric patients can vary from adult patients. Guan et al. [25] noted that 731 (82%) of 890 adult patients had lymphopenia, whereas only eight (16%) children had lymphopenia in this study. Similarly, 481 (61%) of 793 adult patients were found to have an elevated C-reactive protein. In contrast, only ten (20%) children in this study had elevated C-reactive protein. Some laboratory findings were consistent between children and adult groups: leukopenia 38% versus 36% and thrombocytopenia 14% versus 18%.

       " 'The most common pattern of chest CT is groundglass opacities, followed by local patchy shadowing and then local bilateral patchy shadowing, which is consistent with published data [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Our study indicates that chest CT manifested with a predominance of lesions in the subpleural area (41 [95%] of 43) and in lower lung lobes (28 [65%] of 43), especially in the posterior segment (22 [78%] of 28), an area with a relatively dense amount of bronchioles, blood vessels, and alveoli. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first quantitative results on the locations of chest CT lesions for COVID-19 children [21] . COVID-19 is less severe in children than in adults, and the children infected with COVID-19 were at the early stages of the disease when admitted to the hospital. The fact that an overwhelming percentage of pediatric patients had lesions in the subpleural area suggests this site is the first target for the COVID-19 virus.',\n",
       " 'The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is PCR. However, it has been documented that patients with a negative PCR result cannot be definitively ruled out for COVID-19 infection [11, 26] . Our results are consistent with the literature. Among the 50 hospitalized children with positive PCR results, five of them (10%) had negative initial PCR results but showed positive results in subsequent tests. Moreover, 26 patients in group C never had a positive PCR result but had histories of contact with COVID-19 patients. Most of them exhibited clinical symptoms such as fever (81%) and cough (73%). Although they received a negative PCR result at least twice, all 26 patients had similar CT patterns to the PCR-positive COVID-19 patients in group A. Twenty-one (81%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO). Seven (27%) had local patchy shadowing. Five (19%) had bilateral patchy shadowing. Furthermore, our Fisher exact analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in CT image characteristics and lesion location between groups A and C. Although a positive CT alone cannot rule out the possibility of other causes of virus-induced pneumonia [11, 26] , all 26 children were hospitalized and given immediate antiviral and supportive therapy. Whether or not a child presents with pneumonia is one of the key considerations for clinical management, and it is crucial to start treatment as early as possible, considering that many deaths in the adult population are due to complications resulting from severe pneumonia [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .',\n",
       " 'It has been well documented that chest CT is a powerful tool to identify and characterize pneumonia for COVID-19 adult patients [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, there is no publication to study its usefulness in evaluating clinical recovery for children with COVID-19 infection. To determine whether CT is necessary, we investigated the data of 23 patients who had been discharged after effective treatment and had at least two CT scans. All patients had normal body temperatures for more than 3 days at the time of discharge, clinical symptoms disappeared, and PCR tests all returned negative twice at 24-h intervals. Of the 23 children, eight patients did not receive CT scans within the 2 days before their discharge. However, in their most recent CT scan performed in the hospital, most children either still had lesions (50%), or more developed lesions since the previous scan (37%). The remaining 15 discharged children had a CT obtained within 2 days of discharge. Again, ten patients had lesions that were not completely absorbed (67%), two were the same (13%), and lesions in another two became worse (13%). These results indicate that CT may not be better than symptoms in evaluating recovery. Our Cox regression analysis further showed that there was no association between changes in CT lesions and clinical outcomes. The results are consistent with the knowledge that clinical improvement predates radiographic improvement by weeks for children with community-acquired pneumonia. When deciding whether to use CT on children, the harmful effects that radiation may have on a growing body must be considered. Hong et al., in a study of 12,068,821 children aged 0 to 19 years, found a statistically significant increase in cancer in children exposed at least once to diagnostic low-dose ionizing radiation after adjusting for age and sex [29, 30] . Based on our data, we do not recommend using CT for determining clinical recovery unless it is necessary to evaluate the status of pneumonia. For comparison, the current criteria for discharging adult patients infected with COVID-19 in China are (1) normal body temperature for 3 days, (2) two negative PCR tests at 24-h intervals, (3) resolution of clinical symptoms (these three are the current criteria for discharging pediatric patients in this hospital), plus (4) a chest imaging requirement: pulmonary imaging must show significant absorption of lesions. To date, there are no child-specific discharge criteria for COVID-19 in China.',\n",

This paper brings together key scientific uncertainties regarding the use of serological tests to assure immune status and a public health ethics perspective to inform key considerations in the ethical implementation of immunity passport policies. Ill-conceived policies have the potential to cause severe unintended harms that could result in greater inequity, the stigmatization of certain sectors of society, and heightened risks and unequal treatment of individuals due to erroneous test results. Immunity passports could, however, be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery. We conclude that sector-based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible, while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud.

FIT test data showed functional degradation by both ethanol and UV decontamination to different degrees. VHP treated masks showed no significant change in function after two treatments. We also report a single SARS-CoV-2 virucidal experiment using Vero E6 cell infection.

In order to be compatible with reuse, methods of N95 mask SARS-CoV-2 decontamination must remove the viral threat, be harmless to the mask user, and not compromise the integrity of the various mask elements. The decontamination methods utilized, 70% ethanol, ultraviolet light, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide, have previously been demonstrated to be safe for mask users (3) (4) (5) 9) . We found that any ethanol exposure significantly altered mask integrity, as previously reported (7) . We also found that the impact of 70% ethanol on mask integrity appears time dependent. In fact, thirty minutes after 70% ethanol application there was even a larger decline in function, even though the N95 masks feel dry to the touch.

Another limitation is that clear variation exists between N95 mask type and decontamination efficacy. This could be due to technical replicate variation.

Notably, we did not test if ethanol, UV, or VHP impaired N95 fluid-resistant coating on healthcare grade masks. Next, FIT testing, which is utilized by our healthcare system to determine N95 integrity, could in some instances underrepresent actual protection. Likewise, it is also possible ethanol or UV may have resulted in internal mask degradation, producing particulate that may have overestimated the negative impact on N95 mask integrity. While we believe our quantitative FIT testing provides a reasonable estimate of N95 mask function that can aid in comparing imperfect decontamination strategies, we did not conduct the plethora of gold-standard National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assays required for validation. Another limitation is we did not test how time alone impacts SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. It is entirely possible that no decontamination, and allowing for decay of virus infectivity over time, is a preferable strategy when faced with no ideal options.',\n",

Without access to sophisticated droplet or aerosol generating machines and to avoid unnecessary risk, SARS-CoV-2 containing media was applied directly to the mask samples with a pipette. We intended to deliver the highest challenge possible to assess decontamination efficacy. Sample from the 6 highest titer patients in our healthcare system to date were pooled, and 100uL of this concentrated SARS-CoV-2 containing media was directly infiltrated into the N95 masks with the attempt to expose the middle layer. It is hard to imagine a scenario where healthcare workers would face this degree of mask inoculum. Methods able to decontaminate N95 masks under these intense exposure conditions would likely be highly efficacious in actual practice. However, methods that appear less effective in decontaminating SARS-CoV-2 in our experiment, such as UV, would almost certainly be more effective if masks were challenged in a more realistic exposure scenario. Our data may therefore inadvertently underestimate the decontamination efficacy of some methods.',\n",

Evidence acquisition: Each UAS official website was searched between April 8 and 18, 2020, to retrieve any document, publication, or position paper on prioritization strategies regarding both diagnostic and therapeutic urological procedures, and any recommendations on the use of telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery. We collected detailed information on all urological procedures, stratified by disease, priority (higher vs lower), and patient setting (outpatient vs inpatient).

In the outpatient setting, the procedures that are likely to impact the future burden of urologists\\' workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, some UASs recommended special precautions to perform minimally invasive surgery, while others outlined the potential role of telemedicine to optimize resources in the current and future scenarios.',\n",

On the contrary, some differences were found regarding specific cancer surgeries (ie, RC for higher-risk BCa and nephrectomy for larger organ-confined renal masses), potentially due to different prioritization criteria and/or health care contexts. In the future, the outpatient procedures that are likely to most impact the burden of urologists' workload are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lowerrisk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and BPH. These expected changes will put significant strain on urological units worldwide, primarily from a logistical standpoint (urologists' workload, inflow of surgical patients, and waiting lists). Moreover, from a clinical perspective, while patients with lower-risk tumors may not suffer variations in oncological outcomes, for those with nononcological diseases, the overloaded health care scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to worse quality of life and long-term sequelae. In light of these predictions, we should strive to leverage this emergency period to reshape the role of urologists in the future. \",\n",

With increasing prevalence of the disease and recognition of the risk of asymptomatic viral shedding come concerns that the donations may themselves serve as a vector for disease transmission. Furthermore, diagnostic testing of the blood is not feasible as the health care system struggles to address the growing number of cases needing evaluation.',\n",

Pathogen reduction was also effective for whole blood units, suggesting that the riboflavin and UV method can provide a measure of safety against this enveloped, positive-sense, single strand RNA virus. In a rapidly moving environment in which cases are rising by over 15,000 cases per day at the time of writing and major cities across the country struggling to contain the spread of the pandemic, security of the blood supply is in serious question. A pathogen reduction technology would provide a measure of security that would allow donations from asymptomatic adults to continue to support the critically ill requiring transfusions. Recovered patients with antibody response could provide convalescent plasma to help protect health care workers exposed to who will be needed to contain the crisis. Passive immunity could also assist high risk patients and the critically ill to clear viral loads. Previous studies have demonstrated that R + UV PRT is a potential tool to mitigate the risk of infection from convalescent plasma.

Person-to-person transmission and travels were implicated in the initial spread of the outbreaks, but factors related to the late phase of rapidly spreading outbreaks in March and April are still uncertain. A few previous studies have explored the links between air pollution and COVID-19 infections, but more data is needed to understand the effects of short-term exposures of air pollutants and meteorological factors on the spread of COVID-19 infections, particularly in the U.S. disease epicenters. In this study, we have focused on ozone and PM 2.5 , two major air pollutants in New York City, which were previously found to be associated with respiratory viral infections. The aim of our regression modeling was to explore the associations among ozone, PM 2.5 , daily meteorological variables (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, cloud percentages, and precipitation levels), and COVID-19 confirmed new cases and new deaths in Queens county, New York during March and April 2020. The results from these analyses showed that daily average temperature, daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentration, average relative humidity, and cloud percentages were significantly and positively associated with new confirmed cases related to COVID-19; none of these variables showed significant associations with new deaths related to COVID-19. The findings indicate that short-term exposures to ozone and other meteorological factors can influence COVID-19 transmission and initiation of the disease, but disease aggravation and mortality depend on other factors.',\n",

At present, COVID-19 has no specific therapeutic drugs, and the main clinical treatment is symptomatic treatment and control of complications. On March 5, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection (Trial Version 7), which integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into the treatment of COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to summarize recent studies on the clinic application, pharmacological action, chemical substances and mechanism of Qingwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) on the treatment of various diseases. The results suggested that QBD has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic and so on. It has been used in the treatment of sepsis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, infantile pneumonia, sepsis-related encephalopathy, epidemic encephalitis B and other diseases. In addition, this study attempts to explore the possible mechanism of QBD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Through the analysis of the chemical substances, pharmacological action and mechanism of QBD, this paper will provide a reference theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by QBD.\",\n",

It is speculated that its main role is to reduce the level of inflammation in patients. Simultaneously, it plays a role in inhibiting the replication and infection of virus, inhibiting the concurrent bacterial infection, and improving the immunity of the body. However, there are few researches on the mechanism of QBD\\'s action on human coronavirus. Through the study on the mechanism of QBD\\'s multi-channel anti coronavirus action, we hope to provide new ideas for the clinical treatment of COVID-19, which improve the cure rate of patients infected with COVID-19, reduce their mortality, and further explore the pharmacological effect and phase of QBD.

However, there is limited evidence available to inform alcohol policies during such events. In this commentary, we present the range of government actions to control public access to alcohol during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in provinces and territories across Canada. Liquor retailers, including both private and government-run retailers, have been designated as essential services in all jurisdictions, operating under an evolving set of rules. From a public health perspective, keeping liquor retailers open during pandemic-related lockdown restrictions is a delicate decision which poses new risks and considerations about the best strategy for minimizing alcohol-related harms. We discuss the need to strike a balance between supplying public access to alcohol, particularly to those living with dependence, and unintentionally sending the message that alcohol is essential in our lives and encouraging consumption. Given the far-reaching effects of alcohol on health, social, psychological, economic, and work safety outcomes, we describe international guidance for minimizing alcohol-related harms and suggest that a nuanced and evidence-informed discussion about the considerations and impacts of alcohol control measures during a public health emergency should be undertaken.',\n",

Using results from a previous study, we calculated the expected increase in insolation based on measured PM2.5 concentration levels.

It should be noted, though, that the air quality in Delhi in April, even with lockdown, was still worse than the typical air quality in other cities. Looking at histograms in 6 , the closest resemblance we found was Hanoi 2017. Places like London, Los Angeles or Jakarta all had better air quality in 2017 overall than Delhi did in April 2020.

When looking at data form earlier in March or February, we observe no significant deviations from previous years. We also compared the measured insolation anomaly to predictions using the method outlined in 6 . Agreement between simulations and measurements indicate that the drop in air pollution is the root cause for the observed increase in insolation and that the optical characteristics of the air above Delhi are consistent with that of previous instances of low air pollution. We conclude: COVID-19 related measures have improved air quality, which has increased solar insolation in Delhi.',\n",

The adage \"old drug, new trick\" in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs. We found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throatswab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. Methods/design: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up.

Our model accommodates contact tracing and isolation, allowing for comparisons between different types of intervention.

       " \"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in younger patients. Our hypothesis was that intestinal SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression depends on patients' age. We examined duodenal biopsies from 43 healthy human adults. ACE2 gene expression was directly correlated with age (Spearman's r = 0.317, p = 0.039). With each year, duodenal ACE2 expression increased by 0.083 RU. The higher intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression in older patients may impact on their susceptibility to develop intestinal symptoms.\",\n",
       " \"The small bowel may be an important entry site for SARS-CoV-2, as small intestinal enterocytes highly express ACE2 in the brush border membrane (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015; Camargo 2009). Furthermore, viral mRNA may be detected in rectal swabs (even for a longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs) suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral disease transmission Xiao et al. 2020; Holshue 2020) . Reported gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are common and range from nausea and vomiting to diarrhea and abdominal discomfort with more than 10% of patients presenting with diarrhea (Jin 2020; Gu et al. 2020) . Gastrointestinal symptoms seem to be even more pronounced in children (Tian 2020; D'Amico et al. 2020) . The pathophysiology of diarrhea in COVID-19 patients remains unclear, but might be reflective of damage to the gastrointestinal tract and/or altered intestinal permeability resulting in malabsorption and diarrhea. As shown in the present study, small intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression correlates with age in healthy adults. In addition, we could recently show that small intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression in adults was about 1.5 times as high as in newborns, whereas its expression in older children has not been tested (Meier 2018) . ACE2 is known to function as a brush border membrane-bound peptidase, and is required for the expression of amino acid transporters B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) and SIT1 (SLC6A20) for which it functions as an associated chaperon protein (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015; Camargo 2009 ). It is noteworthy to mention that we have recently shown that the amino acid transporter SIT1 [similar to the fructose transporter GLUT 5 (SLC2A5) (Meier 2019)] is not yet expressed in newborn humans (Meier 2018) , and that the association of ACE2 with amino acid transporters has been suggested to interfere with its proteolytic cleavage and thereby with its ability to support SARS-CoV-2 infection (Yan 2020 ). Thus, differential amino acid transporter expression in children versus adults may impact on the susceptibility to intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the expression of ACE2 in small intestine may impact on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and symptoms via its demonstrated effects on intestinal innate immunity and microbiota composition (Hashimoto 2012) . Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that age-dependent changes in intestinal ACE2 expression may impact on the susceptibility to gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms.\",\n",

However, in past epidemics with MERS and SARS-Cov-1 this increased risk was not observed. 22 As in the general population 1 , the most common symptoms in our cohort of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection were fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. As already reported 5,23,24 , we also observed some atypical presentations with predominant digestive symptoms and acute confusion. Interestingly, the severity of pulmonary involvement at the chest CT-scan at admission was not associated with worse clinical outcome. Indeed, some patients with images of severe pulmonary involvement recovered quite well while the only patient currently in ICU had moderate involvement at admission with subsequent dramatic evolution. This suggests that chest CT-scan at admission is useful for diagnosis but does not provide prognostic information. However, other factors may impact the severity of the pulmonary involvement on the first chest CTscan such as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the CT-scan and the presence of underlying chronic pulmonary diseases. Little is known about early markers that may predict the clinical evolution. Tan et al. recently showed that CRP increased early in severe COVID-19 infection, prior to CT findings 25 , suggesting that the initial evolution of CRP levels might provide more prognostic information than early CT scan.',\n",

Even if hydroxychloroquine was safely used in our cohort, we cannot draw any conclusion regarding its efficacy because of the absence of a control group. The currently recruiting DISCOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials (NCT04315948 and NCT04321616, respectively) will provide some answers regarding treatment efficacy in the general population. The results of these trials will then need to be extrapolated to the kidney transplant recipients population. None of our patient received the antivirals currently in the pipeline 33 days after the tocilizumab administration. 15 In our cohort, the kidney function outcome was satisfactory. Although 28% of hospitalized patients experienced AKI, none required hemodialysis. Moreover, kidney function rapidly stabilized after appropriate hydration. To date, we have not observed any acute rejection episodes, but the current follow-up of our patients is short.

As a result, the discourse around new norms has become much more evident and visible in our daily lives and radically impacted on social norms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and we have all become accustomed to new normalities. To this end, planning for, implementing, embedding, and integrating technology to facilitate new norms is incredibly challenging. To exacerbate this, there is a lack of any guidance from governments or policymakers on how to best facilitate these unprecedented changes to work practices. This research described the application of NPT and its usefulness in offering (i) a novel theoretical perspective on the normalisation of new technology-driven work practices, and (ii) practical insights on how NPT can better guide organisations to normalise technology-driven work practices during pandemics. It is envisaged that this framework will explain the implications of pandemics and debate about the normalisation of new tech-driven work practices and transformations. \",\n",
       " 'Non-protocolized fluid administration in critically ill patients, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, fluid administration in patients with Coronavirus disease should be properly guided. Choice of an index to guide fluid management during a pandemic with mass patient admissions carries an additional challenge due to the relatively limited resources. An ideal test for assessment of fluid responsiveness during this pandemic should be accurate in ARDS patients, economic, easy to interpret by junior staff, valid in patients in the prone position and performed with minimal contact with the patient to avoid spread of infection. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are divided into two phenotypes (L phenotype and H phenotype) according to their lung compliance. Selection of the proper index for fluid responsiveness varies according to the patient phenotype. Heart-lung interaction methods can be used only in patients with L phenotype ARDS. Real-time measures, such a pulse pressure variation, are more appropriate for use during this pandemic compared to ultrasound-derived measures, because contamination of the ultrasound machine can spread infection. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all COVID-19 patients. Passive leg raising test is relatively better than mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position.

All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions. Specific information has been released through official channels.

Results: In total, 50 fatal cases were reported: median age was 70 y old, and males were 2.33 times more likely to die than females. The median number of days from the first symptom to death was 13, and that length of time tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and older compared with those younger than 65 (12 days vs 17 days; P = 0.046). Therefore, the older patients had fewer number of days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40; P = 0.012). Conclusions: In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progression to death time was shorter. At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.',\n",

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, Telemedicine seems to be a promising alternative for the inclusion and follow-up visits in clinical research. If the outbreak is still under control, we will start June 1, 2020 to give access to the Gerontopole CRC for those participants to cohort studies aged between 60 and 70 years and in September we will give access to all volunteers. Interestingly the large majority of our participants wanted to continue to be part of our clinical research programs. ',\n",
       " 'This paper describes the evolving role of robotics in healthcare and allied areas with special concerns relating to the management and control of the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 . The prime utilization of such robots is to minimize person-to-person contact and to ensure cleaning, sterilization and support in hospitals and similar facilities such as quarantine. This will result in minimizing the life threat to medical staff and doctors taking an active role in the management of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The intention of the present research is to highlight the importance of medical robotics in general and then to connect its utilization with the perspective of COVID-19 management so that the hospital management can direct themselves to maximize the use of medical robots for various medical procedures. This is despite the popularity of telemedicine, which is also effective in similar situations. In essence, the recent achievement of the Korean and Chinese health sectors in obtaining active control of the COVID-19 pandemic was not possible without the use of state of the art medical technology.',\n",
       " 'This study presents a comprehensive overview of the robotics potential in medicine and allied areas with special relation to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective management of COVID-19 can significantly reduce the number of infected patients and casualties as witnessed in the case of the Chinese outbreak. Since, it has currently turned out to be a global challenge, technologically advanced countries can aid others by donating support equipment and robotic infrastructure to enable a good outcome in controlling this disease. This review substantiates that the introduction of medical robotics has significantly augmented the safety and quality of health management systems compared to manual systems due to healthcare digitization. Classification of medical robots is only done using application based categories to fit every aspect of hospital services ranging from cleaning robots to highly sophisticated surgical robots. Many opportunities are available in the design and operation of medical robots such as a cyber-physical system (CPS), power management using optimized algorithms and renewable sources, as well as fault tolerant control and dependable architectures for reliable and safe operation within the healthcare facilities.

       " 'Lack of effective treatment strategy and vaccine makes SARS-CoV-2 infection a big threat to mankind. Analyzing the host transcriptional changes in response to virus infection will help delineate the biological processes impacted by the virus and will potentially facilitate drug development. Using RNA seq datasets of virus infected lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV), we present a detailed analysis of genes expression changes in response to each of these viral infections. Upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling was observed with all three viral infections. However, upregulation of the cytokine/inflammatory processes, downregulation of mitochondrial organization and respiration processes, and perturbation in the autophagic processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which were absent in IAV infected cells. Upregulation of the inflammatory processes was concordant with the gene expression signature of COVID-19 lungs and with inflammatory symptoms observed in severe cases of COVID-19 patients. Coexpression networks analysis also facilitated the identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) subnetworks of genes in the inflammation and mitochondrial processes that were either coordinately up or downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, respectively. Comparing the expression of marker genes of lung cell types from single cell RNA seq data with expression profile of A549 cells revealed that they likely represent the lung epithelial lineage cells. The cellular processes uniquely perturbed in infected cells that were identified in this analysis likely delineates lung epithelial cells response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n",

Consistently, analysis of DE genes in one of the correlated clusters from WGCNA showed significant enrichment in the interferon signaling processes. Additionally, GeneMANIA analysis of the correlated DE genes in two modules revealed PPI subnetworks of genes involved in interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and NFkB, which were both mostly upregulated in the infected cells. In addition to the ISGs, the JAK-STAT signal transduction genes, which play critical role in type I cytokine (such as IL6) signaling and inflammation (43) (44) (45) , were also upregulated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells ( Fig 4C) . IL6, a pleotropic cytokine, was shown to be elevated in critically ill COVID-19 patients (46) . Consistently, IL6 was upregulated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. IL6 acts via the JAK-STAT signaling through SOCS3 protein kinase (also upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells) to activate the immune response (47) .',\n",

       " 'IL1 signaling is critical for initiating and regulating inflammatory processes in response to infection (49, 50) . Given the upregulation of genes in the cytokine/inflammatory processes was predominantly seen in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at higher viral titer, it is likely that these cells represent a severe COVID-19 infection state. Upregulation of IL6, IL1, and NFkB genes may be contribute to the inflammatory symptoms observed in severe COVID-19 patients (14, 36) . Consistent with the data from lung cell lines, genes upregulated in COVID-19 lung biopsy samples were also significantly enriched in cytokine/inflammatory processes. These data support a central role for cytokine signaling in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Therefore, treatment strategies aimed at mitigating the cytokine effects or complement system could be tested in treatment of COVID-19. One such clinical trial aimed at mitigating the IL6 effects is already underway (NCT04322773).',\n",

Infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 at higher viral titer downregulated the genes in the mitochondrial processes. Consistently, WGCNA also identified a DE gene cluster that annotated to the mitochondrial organization and translation processes. Subsequent GeneMANIA analysis identified a PPI subnetwork of genes involved in mitochondrial translation which were coordinately downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Since mitochondrial import and translation are inter-linked (52, 53), we found that several mitochondrial complex I and translocase genes were downregulated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Reduced complex I expression has been found in many cancer cells and is shown to affect the oxidative phosphorylation, which also impacts the immune cell function (30, (54) (55) (56) (57) .',\n",

No lateralized periodic discharges suggestive of encephalitis or epileptiform discharges (spike and waves), or subclinical and focal seizures were recorded. The abnormalities were sporadic triphasic waves, multifocal or generalized periodic discharges, and rhythmic delta activity. Such triphasic sporadic waves have already been described by Sutter et al. in patients with both structural brain abnormalities and metabolic dysfunctions and were reportedly due to the association of those two pathological conditions [16] . Similarly, multifocal periodic discharges have been reported in a large field of diseases, such as vascular, infectious or other focal cerebral lesions, but also in severe dementia, as well as in metabolic disorders [5, 11] . We also found patients with generalized periodic discharges, which are more rarely described than other aspects but appear to have the same significance. Lastly, six patients had rhythmic delta activity, including a patient with PRES in whom follow-up EEG showed recovery. Multiple etiologies can produce rhythmic delta activity, with no specificity, including metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or various diffuse or focal intracranial diseases including PRES [10] .',\n",

To date, EEG data have been reported in only a few publications. Filatov et al. described a patient harboring clinical features of encephalopathy with normal CSF [7] . Diffuse slowing associated with left temporal sharp contoured waves were seen on EEG. A previous extensive left temporal stroke makes its interpretation questionable.

       " \"In this large UK-wide survey of adults aged 20 and over we show that the majority (~60%) of the study sample succeeded in maintaining their normal PA intensity level during the study period of COVID-19 lockdown. Among those who changed their PA levels, more than twice as many people reduced their PA intensity as increased it. Adults who reported having a doctor's diagnosis of obesity, hypertension, lung disease (including asthma), depression or at least one ADL were more likely to be doing less intensive PA compared to their activity before the epidemic. Compared to the oldest age group (70+), younger age groups were significantly more likely to have changed and to be doing either more, or indeed less intense PA since the lockdown began. Being female, living alone or being without a garden were also associated with doing less intensive PA during the study period. Importantly, we found these associations were independent from all identified confounders. We also applied ML-based text mining to open ended text data about participants' lockdown coping strategies and found that people who expressed sentiments about personal or household risks were more likely to have exhibited a PA behaviour change towards less intense activity. This is important because individual level behaviour change is guided by both subjective and objective risks and because perceptions of risk may act as a conditioning factor in a participant's balancing of concerns of safety, self-isolation and health during the COVID-19 lockdown.\",\n",

       " 'Outbreaks of emerging coronaviruses in the past two decades and the current pandemic 53 of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China highlight the importance of this 54 viral family as a zoonotic public health threat. To gain a better understanding of coronavirus 55 presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet 56 Nam 2013-2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus 57 sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples 58 among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in 59 guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the 60 odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats 61 sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in 62 large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 63 84/151).

We identified 65 six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including 66 the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of 67 animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and 68 avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces in the trade. The mixing of multiple 69 coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, 70 suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic 71 spillover to people. 72 73 Page 4 of 29',\n",
       " 'Recently, the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been demonstrated as a clinically relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others.',\n",

The absence of any other non-specific bands in the western blot also suggests its suitability for use in IHC of different organs of hamsters.',\n",
       " \"The major objective of this study was to check the status of ACE2 expression in different hamster tissues. In human patients, the lung associated pathology is a predominant feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 . Certain earlier studies have shown expression of ACE2 transcripts or protein by lung epithelial cells [15] [16] [17] [18] , hence, just after the reports that ACE2 binds with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, the research and clinical communities assumed that high level of ACE2 expression in lung or other part of the respiratory tract might be a major driving factor in the pathogenesis of this respiratory virus. Our initial immunoblot analysis data showed very trace amount of ACE2 expression in lung tissue lysate (Figure 1) . To get an idea about spatial and cell-type distribution of ACE2 expressing cells in lungs and trachea further IHC analysis was conducted. Interestingly, we didn't find any visible positive staining in the epithelial cells of trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli (Figure 2A) . Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells associated with the wall of blood vessels were also negative for ACE2 staining (data not shown).\",\n",

Corroborating our IHC data, we didn't notice any positive staining when compared with corresponding without antibody stained tissue sections ( Figure 2B) . We believe that the trace amount of lung-associated ACE2 detected in immunoblot analysis might have come from some non-epithelial cells with low abundance and scattered distribution in lung parenchyma, whose presence might not be obvious in stained tissue sections. Our findings corroborate a recent report on human ACE2 expression patterns in different organs published in a preprint form 19 . Together, based on our preliminary findings and available reports 19 we believe that SARS-CoV-2 related lung pathology might be independent or minimally dependent on ACE2 expression status in lungs, which warrants further investigation. Recent studies have reported the presence of SARS CoV-2 viral protein in respiratory tract epithelial cells and lungs of infected hamsters 3 , hence our findings suggest the possible involvement of some other proteins than ACE2 in entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into respiratory and lungs cells 20, 21 .\",\n",

So far most of the literature and publicly available protein expression database have clearly shown high expression of ACE2 protein in human kidney tissues 8, 22 . High expression of ACE2 in the kidney is believed to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenesis and disease severity 22 In our analysis, in addition to kidney and different parts of the gut, brain, liver, tongue are three other extra-pulmonary organs that showed ACE2 expression (Figure 1, 3 & 4) . In brain, mostly the neurons of the cerebral cortex were positive for ACE2 expression. This finding corroborates information available at the human protein atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130234-ACE2/tissue). Expression of ACE2 in hamster brain neuronal cells might help in investing the possible neurological tissue damage due to SARS-CoV-2 infection 30 . In liver tissues, mostly the sinusoidal endothelial cells stained positive for ACE2, but hepatocytes were negatively stained (Figure 3 ). Our immunoblot analysis data also showed ACE2 expression in hamster liver tissues (Figure 1) . The sinusoidal endothelial expression of ACE2 in hamster doesn't match with the expression of ACE2 pattern reported for human liver 16 , and warrants further investigation to understand these contradictory findings. In our analysis, we didn't notice any positive staining in bile duct and gall bladder epithelial cells (data not shown). The human oral mucosal cavity expresses ACE2 and specifically this is highly enriched in tongue epithelial cells 31 . The data from our IHC study also shows expression of ACE2 in both dorsal and ventral stratified squamous epithelium of hamster tongue. Interestingly, the ventral side epithelial cells have very high level of ACE2 expression than dorsal side (Figure 4) . The absence of ACE2 expression in our immunoblot analysis (Figure 1 ) could be due to less proportion of cellular proteins contribution into the total tissue lysate (also a possible reason for low level of β -actin detection).\",\n",

Maybe these people could better justify or rationalize their inactive lifestyles in more severely affected cities.

Second, our sample is not a national representative sample. Our focus was to examine the differential effects on adults depending on the level of disruption, as captured by their job status, existing chronic issues, and exercise levels to identify who in the community of non-COVID-19 cases might need the most help for policymakers and potential caregivers. Third, even though we had data from people who had not been working even before the outbreak started (8.7%) and people who went out of work during the outbreak (1.6%), the sample size of those two groups was small and we are cautious not to report them in the findings.

This finding is in line with the results of a previous study on SARS-CoV-1 that was done by Wong and colleagues (15) .

However, its pathobiology remains incompletely understood and many efforts are underway to study it worldwide. To clarify its pathogenesis to some extent, it will inevitably require lots of COVID-2019-associated deaths at pathologic autopsy. Pathologists from all over the world have raised concern with pathologic autopsy relating to COVID-2019. The issue of whether a person dies from COVID-2019 infection or not always is an ambiguous problem in some cases, and ongoing epidemiology from China may shed light on it. This review retrospectively summarizes the research status of pathologic autopsy in COVID-2019 in China, which will be important for the cause of death, prevention, control and clinical strategies of COVID-2019. Moreover, it points out several challenges at autopsy. We believe pathological studies from China enable to correlate clinical symptoms and pathological features of COVID-2019 for doctors and provide an insight into COVID-2019 disease.',\n",

These SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were tested due to clinical concern, the majority were tested because of fever as primary or only symptom. Remarkably, these infants were well, with little or no respiratory involvement. Many infants had a known positive or symptomatic contact which preceded the infant's illness, although notably 4 infants had no ill contacts, possibly suggesting asymptomatic transmission from a caregiver or other close contact. For young infants being evaluated because of fever, COVID-19 may be an important cause, particularly in a region with widespread community activity. At our institution, SARS-CoV-2 Abbott RT-PCR assay results generally are available within 24 hours, although a Cepheid rapid PCR is available in limited quantities for specific indications (e.g., admission to intensive care units and pre-procedural testing for an urgent surgery). It is unclear whether young infants with fever and a positive rapid test for SARS-CoV-2 require admission. Decision to admit to hospital is based on age, need to assess for bacterial infection, clinical assessment, feeding tolerance, and adequacy of follow up.\",\n",

Thus, although expected that there would be many infants of Latinx ethnicity with COVID-19, there may be additional factors contributing to the disproportionate majority of Latinx cases we observed in this age group. Access to sick-visit care in some primary care pediatric offices has been limited, with practices referring symptomatic children to the ED. Limited access to telemedicine care also may be a factor. In this age group of young infants with fever, however, in-person evaluation by an advanced care medical provider would be recommended.

Many procedures in the gastrointestinal motility laboratory may be considered moderate to high-risk for viral transmission. Healthcare staff working in gastrointestinal motility laboratories are frequently exposed to splashes, air droplets, mucus, or saliva during the procedures. Moreover, some are aerosol-generating and thus have a high risk of viral transmission. There are multiple guidelines on the practices of gastrointestinal endoscopy during this pandemic. However, such guidelines are still lacking and urgently needed for the practice of gastrointestinal motility laboratories. Hence, the Asian Neurogastroenterology and Motility Association had organized a group of gastrointestinal motility experts and infectious disease specialists to produce a position statement paper based-on current available evidence and consensus opinion with aims to provide a clear guidance on the practices of gastrointestinal motility laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. This guideline covers a wide range of topics on gastrointestinal motility activities from scheduling a motility test, the precautions at different steps of the procedure to disinfection for the safety and well-being of the patients and the healthcare workers. These practices may vary in different countries depending on the stages of the pandemic, local or institutional policy, and the availability of healthcare resources.

       " 'At present, the world is facing a pandemic named as COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional Chinese medicine has recommended the use of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species) in the treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to identify the active molecule from the liquorice against different protein targets of COVID-19 using an in-silico approach. The molecular docking simulation study of 20 compounds along with two standard antiviral drugs (Lopinavir and Rivabirin) was carried out with the help of Autodock vina software using two protein targets from COVID-19 i.e. spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) and Non-structural Protein-15 (Nsp15) endoribonuclease (PDB ID: 6W01). From the observed binding energy and the binding interactions, glyasperin A showed high affinity towards Nsp15 endoribonuclease with uridine specificity, while glycyrrhizic acid was found to be best suited for the binding pocket of spike glycoprotein and also prohibited the entry of the virus into the host cell. Further, the dynamic behavior of the best-docked molecules inside the spike glycoprotein and Nsp15 endoribonuclease were explored through all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Several parameters from the MD simulation have substantiated the stability of protein-ligand stability. The binding free energy of both glyasperin A and glycyrrhizic acid was calculated from the entire MD simulation trajectory through the MM-PBSA approach and found to high binding affinity towards the respective protein receptor cavity. Thus, glyasperin A and glycyrrhizic acid could be considered as the best molecule from liquorice, which could find useful against COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'The pharmacoinformatics approaches such as molecular docking and MD simulation studies were carried out to explore a set of molecules belong to the natural products. All the selected molecules including two anti-viral drugs, Lopinavir and Rivabirin were docked in the COVID-19 targets such as spike glycoprotein and Nsp15 endoribonuclease. The binding energies from the molecular docking study and binding interaction were explored in details. Several crucial amino residues were found to interact with all the molecules. A total of six phytochemicals were found promising compounds based on comparative analysis of binding interactions and binding energy with Lopinavir and Ribavirin against spike glycoprotein and Nsp15 endoribonuclease. Further, high binding energy scored one molecule from each of spike glycoprotein (glycyrrhizic acid) and Nsp15 endonuclease (glyasperin A) were used for the MD simulation in complex with the respective target molecule. Many parameters were calculated from the MD simulation and found that both molecules were retained inside the protein in the dynamic states. Finally, the binding free energy of both molecules was calculated from the MD simulation trajectories. High negative binding free energy value of both molecules substantiated their strong affinity towards the target molecule. It can be concluded that that glyasperin A might block the Nsp15 endoribonuclease activity with uridine specificity and glycyrrhizic acid connect well with the widespread binding pocket of spike glycoprotein due to its bulky nature. Moreover, it can be said that the glycyrrhizic acid disturbed the connection of the virus with ACE-2 receptor at entry-level and after entry into host cell glyasperin A inhibits the replication process of the virus. Hence, both proposed molecules might be important molecules to control the COVID-19 subjected to experimental validation.',\n",
       " 'COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has produced a serious emergency for global public health, placing enormous stress on national health systems in many countries. Several studies suggest that cytokine storms (interleukins) may play an important role in severe cases of COVID-19. Neutralizing key inflammatory factors in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) could therefore be of great value in reducing the mortality rate. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in its intravenous (IV) form of administration -RoActemra® 20 mg/mL (Roche)-is indicated for treatment of severe CRS patients. Preliminary investigations have concluded that inhibition of IL-6 with TCZ appears to be efficacious and safe, with several ongoing clinical trials. This has led to a huge increase in demand for IV TCZ for treating severe COVID-19 patients in hospitals, which has resulted in shortages. Here, we present a comparability study assessing the main critical physicochemical attributes of TCZ solutions used for infusion, at 6 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL, prepared from RoActeram® 20 mg/mL (IV form) and from RoActemra® 162 mg (0.9 mL solution pre-filled syringe, subcutaneous form), to evaluate the use of the latter for preparing clinical solutions required for IV administration, so that in a situation of shortage of the IV medicine, the SC form could be used to prepare the solutions for IV delivery of TCZ. It is important to remember that during the current pandemic all the medicines are used off-label, since none of them has yet been approved for the treatment of COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'The active ingredient of the medicinal product RoActemra® in both routes of administration, IV and SC, is TCZ. The TCZ solution for SC administration is supplied as a sterile, colorless to yellowish, preservative-free, liquid solution with a pH of around 6.0 (between 5.5 and 6.5). This solution is supplied in a 1 mL ready-to-use, single-use, prefilled syringe with a needle safety device. Each device delivers 0.9 mL of TCZ solution (162 mg), in a histidine buffered solution composed of TCZ (180 mg/mL), Polysorbate 80, L-histidine and L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate, Larginine and L-arginine hydrochloride, L-methionine and water for injections [11] . On the basis of the available information in the FDA reviews on the original biologics license applications, the subcutaneous TCZ drug product is manufactured with a process change [27] that does not affect quality attributes such as potency, aggregates order size or charge variants, or the levels of processrelated impurities [42] compared to the IV TCZ drug product. The TCZ solution for IV administration [11] is supplied at a lower concentration (20 mg/mL) and with different excipients (sucrose, polysorbate 80, disodium phosphate dodecahydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate and water for injections), with a pH of between 6.2 -6.8. Therefore, in order to assess the possible use of the SC medicine (180 mg/mL) for preparing clinical solutions of TCZ at 6 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL for IV administration, we focused our study on the impact of the dilution required in 0.9 % NaCl on critical physicochemical attributes such as aggregates order size (by measuring visual and soluble particulates, and obtaining size-exclusion chromatographic profiles), charge variants (by obtaining chromatographic cation exchange variant profiles) and structural conformation (by specific fluorescence measures) by comparing results on the solution for infusion prepared from IV and SC medicines. Also, two different batches of the IV and SC medicinal products (RoActemra®) were used to prepare the clinical solutions for infusion, so as to test the inherent variability of TCZ as a biotechnological drug. Our study also examined the stability of the SC clinical solutions stored refrigerated at 4 ºC and protected from daylight for 24 h, so as to compare their stability with that of IV clinical solutions, which is accepted as 24 h [11] . In order to gather more information about the similarity between these IV and SC clinical solutions, a stress study was performed on the 6 mg/mL solution. This study has also proved suitable for testing the stability of TCZ samples as it detected all the changes that took place.',\n",
       " 'As regards aggregates order size, over the 24-h period the solution for infusion prepared using the SC RoActemra proved to be very similar in terms of product quality and stability to the solution prepared with IV RoActemra. No visible particulates were detected in any of the solutions for infusion, nor did we observe aggregates (assessed by DLS and SEC) that were larger than the natural soluble aggregates. In addition, these natural soluble aggregates were detected (by SEC) in the same proportion (natural aggregates/monomers) in the clinical solutions as in their respective medicinal products, IV and SC. The particle population was mainly TCZ monomers with comparable hydrodynamic volume. No differences were detected in the solution prepared for infusion when samples at the same concentration were compared. The only difference was the detection of an unknown compound of non-protein nature in all the SC solutions (not detected at 280 nm in either SEC or CEXC), with an estimated molecular weight of around 15 kDa (by SEC) and a non-basic nature (not retained in CEXC). This unknown compound was also detected in the two batches analyzed of SC RoActemra®, always in proportion with the TCZ concentration, and this proportion was maintained after dilutions. The latter was corroborated by SEC and CEXC results. The unknown compound was not detected in any of the IV solutions.',\n",
       " 'No major differences were detected in the chromatographic charge variant profile of the solution prepared for infusion using the SC RoActemra compared to that for the solutions prepared with the IV medicinal product. An increase in one of the minor basic variants was observed in all the SC samples analyzed, always in the same proportion; this difference in the charge variants is probably due to the use of different CHO clones in the manufacture of TCZ, as indicated in [38] where a very similar charge variant profile to that found in our solutions of SC TCZ is shown. In previous research [22] it was proposed that the deamidations detected for the TCZ originator occur at various asparagine positions, in both heavy and light chains, and the levels of this process were observed to be comparable in the TCZ originator and the HS628 biosimilar. In this case, both TCZ and HS628 showed similar charge variant profiles to those obtained here for all the IV solutions. Regardless of this difference in the charge variants, all solutions demonstrated great stability over the 24-h period.',\n",
       " 'The fluorescence technique was used to compare the tertiary structure of TCZ in the solution prepared for infusion from IV and SC medicines, so providing a reliable assessment of higher order structure integrity, which was shown to be comparable in both solutions, also proving their stability. It was therefore not necessary to analyze the medicinal products themselves, since all the solutions provided high levels of comparability both in terms of the fluorescence spectra obtained and in terms of stability, with no differences detected that require further investigation in the medicinal products or batch to batch.',\n",
       " 'As regards the stress study conducted on the 6 mg/mL clinical solution prepared from TZ IV and SC medicines, results indicated high levels of comparability between the two solutions in terms of degradation patterns. All the solutions were resistant to degradation when submitted to 40 ºC for 24 h. Light induced aggregation was detected by SEC but not by DLS. As expected, acidic (pH=1.87) or basic (pH=11.04) media promoted the highest degradation on TCZ; both media increased the aggregates detected by SEC but the acidic medium degraded TCZ more, in that an important decrease in the monomers was detected by SEC and a great disruption in the charge variant profile was obtained by CEXC. The tertiary structure was also disrupted at these pH values. The TCZ charge variant profile in the basic medium promoted some degradation, although not as much as expected and less extensive than observed in the acidic medium. The samples prepared with IV medicinal products experienced similar degradation to those prepared with SC in all the stress tests to which the TCZ samples were subjected. An interesting additional finding was the resistance to degradation of the unknown compound detected in the SC samples, which was detected by both SEC and CEXC in unaltered condition.',\n",

The SC clinical solutions also demonstrated high comparability with the IV clinical solutions in terms of stability over 24 h and degradation patterns when subjected to controlled degradation studies.',\n",
       " 'The minor differences detected between the IV and SC clinical solutions were already present in the medicinal products used to prepare these solutions, and were not related with the dilutions; they are not batch-to-batch related and instead are directly related with the medicinal product, i.e. IV or SC used. TCZ in its SC form (RoActemra® 162 mg) does not therefore suffer any degradation as a consequence of its dilution in 0.9 % NaCl to prepare the clinical solutions diluted at 6 and 4 mg/mL for infusion. The dilutions of the excipients did not affect the stability of the diluted solutions over 24 h, when stored refrigerated at 24 ºC protected from daylight.',\n",

This means that in the event of a shortage of intravenous RoActemra 20mg/mL, as happened during the Covid-19 emergency, the solution contained (0.9 mL) in the prefilled syringes of SC RoActemra 162 can be used to prepare the solutions diluted in 0.9 % NaCl required for intravenous infusion.',\n",

However, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HCQ group (adjusted hazard ratio 2.61, 1.10-6.17, p=0.03), compared to the control.

Motivated by the ongoing response to COVID-19, we provide a toolkit of statistical and mathematical models beyond the simple SIRtype differential equation models for analysing the early stages of an outbreak and assessing interventions. In particular, we focus on parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in the data, and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed subpopulations, such as households and care homes. We illustrate these methods by applying them to the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " 'In this manuscript we have presented a range of mathematical tools to tackle infectious disease outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'In particular, these tools address various technical questions posed by the authors to support the ongoing public health response to COVID-19. This toolkit considers both estimation efforts for key parameters, and investigative efforts (often numerical simulations) in gauging the effectiveness of various intervention or control measures. Joint consideration of estimation and simulation efforts is critical. Parameter estimates are obtained using a certain set of assumptions regarding the data, and investigations or simulations utilising these estimates should ensure that their underlying assumptions are consistent. These challenges in model construction and applicability of statistical methods are compounded by the limitations of the data with which decisions must be made. Some of the biases present in the data can be addressed with an improved data collection methodology -often challenging in the context of a fast-moving outbreak -but many are also inherent to the nature of early outbreak data [16, 47] . The consequent lack of intuitive insight from this data underscores the need for careful parametric estimates, especially considering the large variability in predicted outcomes resulting from small differences in parameters. Even with robust estimates for some parameters, many other parameters are challenging to estimate using the available data. Therefore, models need to address this variability and uncertainty in order to inform public health policy.',\n",
       " 'We have presented methods to address biases arising from a growing force of infection, changes in the reporting rate, truncated data samples and a varying travel rate. We use these methods to account for these biases when estimating delay distributions, such as the incubation period and hospitalisation-to-death delay, and the growth rate/doubling time (results given in Table 5 ). These biases can have significant impact when estimating key parameters: the mean incubation period estimates for COVID-19 range from 3.48 days without correcting for truncation to 4.84 days with the correction, and the doubling time in Hubei province decreases from 3.15 days without correcting for travel to 2.77 days. These differences can significantly alter our understanding of the outbreak, and could have a large impact on policy and public health. For instance, underestimating the incubation period may lead to quarantine strategies failing to identify infected individuals if the quarantine length is too short. Overestimating the doubling time (or underestimating the growth rate) will underestimate the risk posed to the host population -both in terms of final size of the epidemic and the rate at which it spreads, which can have significant public health impacts as discussed in [68] .',\n",
       " 'It is important to note that the above-mentioned biases, and consequent impact of implementing the methods correcting for their presence, may vary across setting. As an example, the potential underestimation of the When an outbreak occurs in an enclosed group, such as a large gathering, we may wish to know how many individuals are likely to be infected. We developed a statistical method to estimate the first generation size based on the number of symptomatic individuals, taking care to account for the uncertainty in this quantity.',\n",
       " 'This ready reckoner can inform testing of large groups to help control the disease spread, but does not apply to later generations or the possible interventions enacted on the population.',\n",
       " 'Building on these enclosed population scenarios, we have developed a set of models that investigate public con-trol measures or interventions on enclosed populations, such as households and care homes. These structured descriptions improve the population risk profiles relative to assumptions of homogeneous mixing. A complementary aspect to a structured population when modelling interventions is adherence. Motivated by vaccination modelling, we consider leaky adherence, where every individual/household chooses to adhere or not whenever an event occurs, and all-or-nothing adherence, where some households adhere every time and some never adhere.',\n",
       " 'We observed that in a homogeneous population, although the two types of adherence predict the same growth rate and final size, the timing of the peak and the early growth can be faster under all-or-nothing adherence.',\n",
       " 'This insight, combined with lessons from the vaccination literature, suggests that efforts should focus on ensuring complete adherence in individuals/households with some level of pre-existing adherence, rather than pushing non-adherent individuals/households to change behaviour.',\n",
       " 'Dedicated modelling of disease spread in care homes is essential due to the documented history of co-morbidity of their residents during pandemics [34, 88, 89, 90, 91] . We do so by regarding care homes as closed populations that are subjected to a force of infection from an external epidemic. We develop a tool for analysing the risk posed to this population by determining the peak size of the epidemic within the care homes and the number of deaths. Applying this model to COVID-19, we find that by \"cocooning\" the care homes, i.e. shielding them to reduce the chance of introduction from the external outbreak, we can significantly reduce the size of the peak and therefore reduce the number of deaths. However, assessing the necessary level of shielding requires accurate characterisation of the external force of infection, and underestimating this may invalidate shielding efforts. A limitation to the proposed model is the deterministic within care home epidemic. However, since the average size of care homes is relatively large and we assume a high R 0 within care homes, the deterministic assumption is unlikely to significantly alter the conclusions.',\n",
       " 'When modelling households however, we are concerned with much smaller population sizes. Therefore, it is important to consider stochastic effects within each household, combined with between-household dynamics. We consider two different household models: one which contains features of both within-and between-household transmission, where small-scale transmission can be linked to the epidemic on a population level, and another which facilitates more detail in the within-household transmission and delay distributions, but with reduced correspondence to the population-wide transmission. With the first model, a 65% adherence to household isolation appears insufficient to control the epidemic without severe global reductions in transmission. Coupled with a short term global reduction, the epidemic can be controlled, but upon lifting the global intervention, which could take the form of a lockdown, household isolation is insufficient to maintain control. For the second model, we look into changing the strength of adherence, and the impact this can have on achieving control.',\n",
       " 'Indicative but reasonable parameter values suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak can potentially be controlled using household isolation strategies, provided the level of adherence is sufficiently high. However, such a high level of adherence may be difficult to maintain in the long-term and this modicum of control is anyway highly sensitive to the chosen parameters. We further investigated the efficacy of various isolation or quarantine measures. A policy of individual isolation struggles to curtail the epidemic for any adherence. Instead, mixed isolation, whereby first the whole household isolates and any individual infected during isolation goes on to self isolate after household isolation is lifted, appears to be the most cost-effective strategy.',\n",
       " 'Countries have put into place strict social distancing and lockdown intervention to suppress or regain control of epidemics that threaten to overwhelm the health system and cause massive mortality, but they cannot be sustained in the long term without growing social and economic costs. We have shown however, that the probability of the epidemic becoming extinct once these policies are lifted, even when very few cases remain, is very small. We therefore consider a contact tracing intervention as a potential strategy for managing the COVID-19 outbreak, once severe lockdown interventions are lifted. We developed a household-level contact tracing model to explore the feasibility of combining these strategies to control the epidemic. Firstly, we noted that by using knowledge of household structure, we can reduce the burden on the contact tracing process by isolating household and removing them from the contact tracing process once an infected member has been identified. Secondly, we investigated how contact tracing combined with household isolation may drive the disease to extinction, finding that aggressive contact tracing coupled with household isolation can drive the epidemic to extinction under the indicative parameters assumed, when starting with a single infection.',\n",
       " 'However, the time until extinction can be impractically long, which risks the contact tracing capacity being overwhelmed, suggesting such a strategy may be infeasible in practice. A less aggressive strategy could be implemented that would be less likely to overwhelm local health agencies. Whilst it may not lead to extinction, this can still be beneficial at mitigating and controlling the spread of an outbreak as part of a test, trace and isolate strategy.',\n",

To address some of these, we have described a variety of techniques to serve as part of a generally applicable toolkit. However, our proposed models, and many other models, are subject to important limitations which must be considered prior to their application. Key among these is the lack of heterogeneous population mixing, such as through age-stratification [66] and different risk-groups [83] , and spatio-temporal variations [45] , all of which influence modelling estimates and predictions. Nevertheless, the relative simplicity of the presented models allows for the development of qualitative intuition regarding the efficacy of various intervention methods, whilst providing tractable theoretical frameworks which can be further developed and better inform policy-makers.',\n",

In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.',\n",

This suggests that, despite the seriousness of Covid-19, it is possible to improve mood by engaging with positive Covid-19-related online activities, and supports the notion that altruism is good for the altruist (Post, 2005) . Our finding that offering support may reduce anxiety is also in line with meta-analytic evidence suggesting that volunteering has a positive impact on mental health (Jenkinson et al., 2013) . In contrast, the finding that those engaged in general concerns (such as responding to anti-social behaviour) became more anxious, supports the notion of Covid-19 catastrophising, which Wiederhold (2020) describes as the amplification of anxiety stemming from powerlessness. These results suggest that it may not be online engagement with Covid-19 itself that shapes mood, but whether the engagement is altruistic or not. However, the effects described were only seen when it came to feelings of anxiety (or calm), rather than feelings of empowerment or reassurance.',\n",
       " \"When it came to empowerment, the non-significant findings were a surprise, as several OCSI engagement items appeared to be empowering (e.g. to connect with or build communities; to solve problems; or to advocate or raise awareness). This might be because empowerment is a predictor of mood (anxiety) when it comes to catastrophising, rather than an outcome of OCSI engagement. The findings for reassurance could be explained by sample size, as only 27% of the participants engaged to seek support (e.g. because they felt unsafe or they needed company). It might also be that combining empowerment and reassurance into one outcome variable was confounded by the different motivations to engage in the first place. However, it is also worth noting that we measured mood using participants' retrospective impressions, and the model only explained 10 percent of the variance, so it would be worth testing relationships between OCSIs and mood also via other means.\",\n",

This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.\",\n",
       " \"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.\",\n",
       " 'To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform weakly-supervised computer-aided COVID-19 detection with a large number of CT volumes from the frontline hospital at the present epidemic period. By designing an effective weakly-supervised deep learning-based algorithm and training it on CT volumes collected before Jan 23, 2020 with only patient-level labels, the testing results on 131 CT scans collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were very impressive, e.g., the PR AUC value was 0.975. On the ROC curve, the algorithm obtained sensitivity and specificity values larger than 0.9, which were both clinically applicable.',\n",
       " 'The motivation of this study was to utilize AI to alleviate the problem of shortage of professional interpretations for CT images when the epidemic is still fast spreading. Though there were many effective applications of medical AI in previous studies [13, 23] , developing AI for automatic COVID-19 detection was still a challenging task. Firstly, in the current emergency situation, the number of enrolled patients is relatively smaller compared with that used in previous studies [13, 23] ; and patients enrolled in our study were clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19, because the majority of them did not undergo the nucleic acid testing due to the sudden outbreak and limited medical resource in such a short time period. Secondly, the lesions of COVID-19 in CT volumes were not labeled by radiologists and only patientlevel labels (i.e., COVID-positive or COVID-negative) were utilized for training the AI algorithm in our study. Thirdly, some small infected areas of COVID-19 have the potential to be missed even by professional radiologists, and whether it is feasible to be detected by deep learning-based 3D DCNN model remains unclear. We hypothesized to solve these problems by proposing a delicate 3D DCNN, i.e., DeCoVNet. It solved the first problem by applying extensive data augmentation on training CT volumes to obtain more training examples. The second problem was solved by regarding the COVID-19 detection problem as a weakly-supervised learning problem [24] , i.e., detecting COVID-19 without annotating the regions of COVID-19 lesions. In the designed DeCoVNet, we used the spatially global pooling layer and the temporally global pooling layer to technically handle the weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection problem. The third problem was addressed by taking the advantages of deep learning and utilizing a pre-trained UNet for providing the lung masks to guide the learning of DeCoVNet.',\n",
       " 'The deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithm used in our study is effective compared to recent deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis methods. On the task of predicting the risk of lung cancer [13] , the deep learning model was trained on 42290 CT cases from 14851 patients and obtained 0.944 ROC AUC. On the task of critical findings from head CT [23] , the deep learning model was trained on 310055 head CT scans and obtained ROC AUC of 0.920. In our study, only 499 scans were used for training, but the obtained ROC AUC was 0.959. By comparing the data between them, it was able to find that the task of COVID-19 detection may be easier and the proposed deep learning algorithm was very powerful. As for the erroneous 12 false negative predictions in our results, the most possible explanations after we rechecked the original CT images were listed as follows: those lesions were slightly increased in CT densities, and images of those ground-glass opacities were very faint without consolidation.',\n",
       " \"Our study provided a typical and successful solution for developing medical AI for emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. While we were developing this AI, doctors in Wuhan were still extremely busy with treating a huge number of COVID-19 patients and it may be impossible for them to annotate the lesions in CT volumes in the current austere fight against this epidemic. Thanks to the weaklysupervised algorithm in this study, locations of pulmonary lesions in CT volumes are not necessary to be annotated, and radiologists' annotating efforts can be minimized, i.e., only providing patient-level 10 .

       " 'Limitations of this study There are still several limitations in this study. First, network design and training may be further improved. For example, the UNet model for lung segmentation did not utilize temporal information and it was trained using imperfect ground-truth masks, which could be improved by using 3D segmentation networks and adopting precise ground-truth annotated by experts. Second, the data used in this study came from a single hospital and cross-center validations were not performed. Third, when diagnosing COVID-19, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner, since the algorithm was based on deep learning and its explainability was still at an early stage. Related work of all limitations mentioned above will be addressed in our further studies.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, without the need for annotating the COVID-19 lesions in CT volumes for training, our weakly-supervised deep learning algorithm obtained strong COVID-19 detection performance. Therefore, our algorithm has great potential to be applied in clinical application for accurate and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, which is of great help for the frontline medical staff and is also vital to control this epidemic worldwide.',\n",
       " 'The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries.',\n",
       " 'Our study demonstrates that pooling of 5 negative and/or 4 negative and one positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal samples in the same RT-PCR run can effectively identify all negative samples and detect the positive sample. Furthermore, similar detection results were observed when comparing automated and manual extraction of the sample. Results of the sample without nucleic acid extraction, was unsatisfactory, with a significant increase in CT values, and thus for risk of a false negative result. . This study is complementary to ours as they used samples negative for other viruses, not including samples with known CT values. Another study from Israel, found that a single positive sample could be detected even in pools of extracted nucleic acid of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10% 8 . Multi-sample pools can be a good alternative to increase testing throughput, using less reagents and offering faster results. This is relevant for underdeveloped or developing countries, where resources may be scarce. The possibility of increasing the number of samples for SARS-Cov-2 detection could significantly help countries with reduced resources, to obtain better outcomes for the COVID-19 pandemic. For post-pandemic screening of large populations, sample pooling also will represent an important alternative. Our study has the limitation of having performed only 31 pools on 63 nasopharyngeal samples (40 negatives and 23 positives), however, results were consistent and provide relevant information for the implementation of strategies that might allow optimizing the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We included 5 samples in each pool which seems adequate in our current situation with a near overall 10% positivity rate. In areas with lower positivity rates, especially in future post-pandemic testing, increasing sample numbers in the pool can be considered. Finally, we did not test the inclusion of more than one sample in each pool, however, we would not expect this to modify the observed results.',\n",

The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods and the fatality rate.',\n",
       " 'A high number of secondary infections by COVID-19 can take place when an infected individual is introduced into a community. It is essential to simulate the process of infection (and death) in advance, to apply adequate control measures and mitigate the risk of virus diffusion. One of the most used mathematical algorithms to describe the diffusion of an epidemic disease is the SEIR model, that we have applied to compute the number of infected, recovered and dead individuals on the basis of the number of contacts, probability of the disease transmission, incubation and infectious periods, and disease fatality rate.',\n",
       " 'A first analysis of the results of the model is based on parameters of the SARS disease and we assume that the parameters do not change during the whole epidemic. Reducing the number of contacts, the peak decreases in intensity but moves to later times, although it is wider. Moreover, more exposed people does not affect the intensity of the peak, but anticipates the epidemic. The incubation period has also an impact on the results, with higher values delaying the epidemic. The dependence on the initial number of infected people is weak apparently if R 0 does not change during the epidemic.',\n",

The results show that the peak occurs to nine times more exposed individuals. These values are obtained by constraining the incubation and infectious periods to values reported in the literature. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds, we obtain slightly higher incubation and infectious periods compared to the first case, but a much higher IFR (2.25 % versus 0.57 %), while much more exposed individuals yields an incubation period of 13 days and a lower IFR (0.6 %).',\n",

After the partial opening of the economy and under a less stringent lockdown, the reproduction number could increase and induce a second outbreak of the epidemic. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the parameters of the epidemic and characteristics of the disease, and it is clear from these calculations that the usefulness of simple models to predict is limited, and that their main role is to help in our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic.',\n",

Even if the predictions are inaccurate, it has been clear to scientists from many decades to date that quarantine, social distancing and the adoption of very strict health and safety standards are essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Quarantine was even implemented in medieval times to fight the black death before knowing the existence of viruses. In this sense, this pandemic reveals the failure of policy makers, since it is well known from basic modeling results that anticipating those measures can save thousand of lives and even prevent the pandemic. The interface of science, society and politics is still uneasy, even in highly developed countries, revealing a disregard for scientific evidence.

       " 'Cardiopulmonary assessment was successfully and safely completed in all COVID-19 patients using the 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system. Image acquisition, labeling, and analysis were performed as per established examination protocol, without complications. This underscores that the advances and safety of current computer networks and communication technology allows long-distance ultrasonic image acquisition, transmission, analysis, and processing, with high-precision synchronization of multiple audio-visual signals. It can assist in the construction of remote real-time ultrasound collaborations, interactive operability, and consultation modes. Current ultrasonic robot technology has made considerable advances, and rich experience has been accumulated through many clinical applications. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 33 Studies have indicated that the quality of images captured by robot-assisted remote ultrasound systems correlate well with those captured by conventional ultrasound. [34] [35] [36] Robot technology has been reported for assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases previously, [37] [38] [39] but the application of a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system for use in lung disorders has not been reported to date. 5G networks have a high data transmission rate (peak rate up to 20 Gbps) and low network delay (approximately 1-10 ms). Consequently, no noticeable delay occurred during scanning, and each examination was completed quickly, facilitating further clinical implementation of 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system. 40. In addition, we used strict infection control practices, including the hand hygiene of assistants, cleaning and disinfection of the floor, object surfaces, and the patient-side instrument. In summary, the application of this system allowed us to surpass time and space restrictions and guaranteed minimization of cross-infection risk in the assessment of COVID-19 patients.',\n",

       " 'The LUS was used for overall lung evaluation of COVID-19 patients in our study. The LUS was significantly higher in the severe than in the non-severe group, probably because vascular and inflammatory reactions were more exaggerated in severe cases, causing some bronchial embolisms to block the bronchiole and terminal bronchiole partially or completely, triggering lung atelectasis or consolidation, eventually leading to ventilation dysfunction. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Current literature 29 indicates that, in a controlled human model of lung air content variation, the LUS can reliably record lung aeration changes. This method was successfully applied to assess extravascular lung water (EVLW), which predicts mechanical ventilation weaning failure and allows monitoring aeration in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The LUS is closely related to several acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnostic and prognostic indices, such as the EVLW index, lung injury score, respiratory system compliance, and PaO2/FiO2, and serves as a death-risk prediction index. 41, 42, 51 . In this study, one non-severe case (8.3%, 1/12) and four severe cases (36.4%, 4/11) also had pulmonary bacterial infections, with LUSs of 14 and 4-29, respectively. Compared with COVID-19 patients with non-pulmonary bacterial infections, these patients might have displayed aggravated lung lesions, but this requires further research. Some studies 51 have shown that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities have significantly higher risks of ICU admission, invasive ventilation, and death than that in patients without comorbidities, with risk increasing proportionately to the number of comorbidities.',\n",

The left ventricular short-axis view offered the only clear view in this study that could be used to assess the size and function of the ventricle.We measured the areas of the right and left ventricles at end-diastole and calculated the area ratio (RVEDA/LVEDA). When the ratio is greater than 0.6, it indicates that the right ventricle is dilated (i.e., potential impaired function). When accompanied by contradictory interventricular septal movements, this indicates pulmonary heart disease. Moreover, we used the'eyeballing' visual estimation method to quickly assess the LVEF and left ventricular wall motion. Studies have shown that this method has a good correlation with radionuclide scanning and other quantitative methods.\",\n",

The examination results could help to rule out lung diseases caused by cardiogenic factors (e.g., cardiogenic pulmonary edema), clarify the cause and classification of shock, and assess fluid responsiveness. [52] [53] [54] Some COVID-19 patients have obvious cardiac dysfunction, but all our patients had normal RVEDA/LVEDA and LVEF, perhaps due to the limited viral damage to myocardial cells or damage control by early treatment. 45, 46, 55 Four severe COVID-19 patients (36.4%, 4/11) had pericardial effusions (3-10-mm wide), and one of these had increased α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (291 U/L) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (375 U/L). There were no such cases in the non-severe group; thus, the underlying mechanism requires investigation.',\n",

The establishment of an examination protocol helped in performing standardized examinations, as well as in the learning, training, and promotion of the technology. But, the study had some limitations. Since we conducted ultrasound examination for COVID-19 patients only at a specific disease stage, dynamic evaluation of disease progression was not possible. Hence, further follow-up ultrasound data must be collected, and their correlations with clinical findings should be analyzed to observe the evolution and outcome of the disease. Lung diseases of different etiologies can have similar ultrasound characteristics; consequently, this method can not be used to determine etiology. Differences in age, oxygen saturation, eosinophils, lymphocytes, cardiac markers, CRP, and cytokines between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Therefore, a comprehensive assessment needs to be conducted in conjunction with the medical history, clinical manifestation, and laboratory test data. In addition, the 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system is still in its infancy, and requires further improvements: (1) Restrictions of the examination position of the patient (especially, critically ill patients) and operating angle of the robotic arm made some body parts difficult for the robotic arm to reach. The use of only one convex array probe markedly affects the quality of cardiac images, due to the frequency limitation. Although the initial application of the 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in the COVID-19 epidemic has achieved good results, it can not wholly replace CT and other examinations.',\n",

With this aim, we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis, which allows gaining new insights into the main conformational changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human cells angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favor human cell invasion.

The proposed antibodies show in silico high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high-affinity antibodies against present and future coronaviruses able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ACE2.

Furthermore, the employed tools indicate a local break down in structural energy in correspondence of the proposed mutated sites at the antibody-receptor complex interfaces, reflecting an increased affinity (in terms of newly established interactions) among the investigated m396-based mutated antibodies and SARS-CoV-1/2 spike RBDs.',\n",

Studying all the cited interactions in the same pdb-molecular session has allowed highlighting the most crucial ACE2 portions involved in direct interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, suggesting that the administration of the recombinant RBD, a spike monomer or the entire spike trimer, if correctly folded, might result in the efficient triggering of antibody production from our plasma b-cells, reducing COVID-19 complications (supporting what has been recently proposed [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] ).',\n",

       " 'A molecular framework like the ones here proposed will also help in studying the putative role of ACE inhibitors in perturbing ACE2-RBD interactions. Indeed, it was recently proposed that patients treated with ACE inhibitors might be more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection [91] . Although ACE1 (refseq accession number: NP_068576.1, representing the main target of ACE inhibitors) and ACE2 (NP_690043.1, testis isoform or NP_000780, somatic isoform, among the most studied isoforms) share the 40% of identical residues, few uncertain data about ACE inhibitors and a possible greater selectivity for ACE1 versus ACE2, or on their effect on ACE1/2 expression regulation are available in the literature [91, 92] . From a structural comparison, it is observed that the RMSD of the crystallized native ACE2 coordinates (1r42.pdb, [93] ) and ACE1 coordinates (1o8a. pdb, [94] ) is lower than 2.5 Å.',\n",

       " 'Conversely, we cannot establish if the slightly higher RMSD observed between the native ACE2 (1r42.pdb) and ACE2 complexed with SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD (0.41 Å, 2ajf.pdb) and SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (1.2 Å, 6vw1.pdb) can be attributed exclusively to interactions with SARS-CoV-1/2 spike RBDs because the observed RMSDs are of the same order of magnitude of the experimental resolution of the investigated crystallized structures.',\n",
       " 'However, also admitting that ACE1 inhibitors at the employed dosage would target ACE2, with the same efficiency observed versus ACE1, the presence of those inhibitors in ACE2 binding cavity should not be able to induce an important conformational change in ACE2, which might favor a greater affinity of ACE2 versus SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.',\n",
       " 'Thus, the only mechanism for which, patients treated with ACE inhibitors would be more exposed to SARS-CoV-2, would rely on a positive feedback induced by ACE inhibitors in ACE2 expression. Nevertheless, pieces of evidence in support of this hypothesis need to be deepened [92, 97] . Along with manuscript revisions, a couple of interesting papers have been published on this concern showing that patients treated with ACE inhibitors show a slightly less severe set of complications due to COVID-19 than patients that do not use ACE inhibitors [98, 99] .',\n",

Indeed, in this case, fold recognition tools have helped us in identifying crystallized structures of ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins similar to those under investigation in just 2 days. Furthermore, performing structural comparative analysis has allowed us to identify a possible good starting point, like the ones represented by m396, already crystallized in complex with SARS-CoV-1 spike RBD, for building the proposed antibodies in just few weeks. The same strategy might be promptly applied also for future infections by those researchers involved in drawing new antibodies and/or developing new vaccines, i.e. for dealing with future coronaviruses outbreaks.',\n",

The proposed model, based on the only available spike protein (6b3o.pdb) crystallized in post-fusion conformation, will help in understanding the mechanism allowing the virus envelop fusion with host cell plasma membranes, through and following interactions with ACE2. Notably, it was possible to propose a 3D model for the main states reached by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through the cited conformational changes, leading to the post-fusion conformation, because a closed state in which RBD residues interacting with ACE2 are not accessible, a partially open state with one or two RBD accessible subunits, a final open state, in which RBD residues interacting with ACE2 at each RBD subunits are accessible and ready to establish interactions with ACE2, and a post-fusion conformation, were already described for MERS-CoV (6nb3.pdb; 6nb4.pdb) and SARS-CoV-1 (6nb6.pdb; 6nb7.pdb; 6b3o.pdb) spike proteins [45, 53] . Considering that ACE2 works as a dimer and the spike protein consists of a trimer, it might be even speculated that a fusion complete mechanism might involve three ACE2 dimers and two spike trimers, simultaneously.',\n",

Indeed, the RMSD between the coordinates of the crystallized (6x2c. pdb) closed state and our starting crystallized structures (6vsb.pdb; 6vxx.pdb) depicting a possible closed state of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is lower than 1.3 Å. Furthermore, the RMSD between the coordinates of the crystallized partially open states of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6x2b.pdb, showing two accessible RBDs and 6x2a.pdb, showing one accessible RBD) and our corresponding 3D models, showing two or one accessible RBDs, is lower than 1.4 Å, in both cases.',\n",
       " 'Our analysis through the provided 3D model in postfusion conformation, coherently to the crystallized 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in pre-fusion conformation, further confirms the presence and stability of a sort of channel at the interface of the three monomers that could represent a good target site for a virtual screening of a chemical/drug library, aiming to identify a small molecule/ peptide with high affinity for the central region of the spike protein trimer, which should be able to block conformational changes leading to post-fusion conformation. Indeed, it was recently observed that a peptide named EK1 (5zvm. pdb, [100] ), showing high affinity for the 920-935 protein region (YP_009724390.1 residues numbering), was able to prevent conformational changes and post-fusion conformation stabilization. The screening of a drug/peptide library would help in identifying an already approved drug/peptide, maybe structurally related to EK1, with high affinity for the spike trimer central channel, that might be immediately translated to the patient bed-side, after successful in silico analyses, in the context of the drug-repositioning approaches [101, 102] .',\n",

At the same time, already at the preclinical level, the administered vaccines based on the administration of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ( [69] [70] [71] or on the administration of the single SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, will induce the production of specific antibodies that might be sequenced and modelled in silico. On this concern, the provided molecular network will help in quantifying interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (also in cases of different RBD variants [109] ) and the newly investigated antibodies, i.e. lower the calculated binding energy in the modelled complex, higher the likelihood to obtain strong RBD-antibody interactions, that would result in more efficient treatments.',\n",

       " \"This concise manuscript is intended to spotlight some of the factors involved in the COVID-19 process focusing on our current efforts to shine some light by proving laboratory evidence to support our working hypothesis. People respond differently to COVID-19 some without major clinical problems, others, especially older population or with comorbidities, develop severe or fatal complications [1, 2] . This virus does not recognize age or rank and where the individual variability appears to matter is how people respond to viral infectivity: the good responders overcome the virus by developing high affinity antibodies, whereas the poor responders are doomed to severe health Issues. It is nevertheless more than intriguing to note that the highest antibody concentrations are noted in the most severe patients, and this does not always correspond to the viral load detected by PCR [5, 15] . We emphasize that, in addition to the viral deleterious effects of infection in lungs and organs, and stimulation of the immune system, a possible rebound trigger could be induced by an autoimmune response, especially when complications are delayed from the initial symptoms. The mechanisms of viral infection and entry into cells through the ACE-2 receptor create a unique context for development of allo-or autoantibodies, which can induce their harmful effect on the body's cells and tissues exposing ACE-2. This mode of action is similar to that of 2002 SARS-CoV [16] , but SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2. Therefore COVID-19-induced activation of hemostasis and immune reactions remains, for a while, in the spotlight to be fully proven without any doubt. Autoimmune complications, although rare, have been observed in many infectious diseases, as for example anti-coagulation Protein S in varicella, anti-prothrombine, anti-Platelet Factor 4, anti-FXIII, etc. Autoantibodies are investigated only because of the associated clinical syndromes induced (as Lupus Anticoagulant, thrombosis, bruises). Understanding the various routes of pathology development can help to design the most efficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches as recently reviewed [9, 12] . Recombinant ACE2 is being developed for treating the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other strategies in the spirit of unities in these massive risky periods, in the real crisis time, requiring prompt action, are warranted. Specific recommendations for a standardized preparation, and an optimal use of convalescent plasma at a global level are greatly needed in COVID 19 patients. This will be helpful in designing future clinical trials in this area of investigation.\",\n",
       " 'Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure.',\n",
       " 'Accurate and prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is of utmost importance in limiting spread of the disease as well as for identifying patients at risk for rapid deterioration. Epidemiological data from other countries, such as South Korea, China, and Italy have shown that increased testing, identification of infected individuals, and prompt medical attention can result in markedly lower rates of R 0 , disease propagation, and ultimately disease mortality [11] . With several treatments currently under development and investigation, diagnosis will be of increasing importance. Testing in the USA remains limited, with most centers only testing patients with lower respiratory symptoms and positive exposure history. The cohort presented herein, along with many other published studies, show that this testing strategy may be overly restrictive as there is a significant rate of communal and sub-clinical spread [4, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] . It is well documented that many patients who are RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 may have an incubation period of 5 days and can transmit the virus without prolonged close contact with other individuals [5, 12] . Here, we show in seven patients without lower respiratory symptoms, documented fever, or known exposure that COVID-19 infection can not only be present, but subsequently result in high rates of intubation and mortality. Many centers do not incorporate imaging in their RT-PCR algorithms and there remains diagnostic uncertainty regarding patients with imaging consistent with COVID-19 but are otherwise of low clinical suspicion. We argue that patients with suspicious imaging findings, especially CT, even in the lowincidence and low clinical suspicion setting shown here, warrants prompt RT-PCR testing. Additionally, as detection of these patients is difficult, data support the institution of widespread quarantine protocols to contain disease propagation.',\n",

The lab-confirmed disease incidence at the time of this report remained low, with only 30 lab-confirmed infections and nine in-hospital infections. Despite this, imaging was able to incidentally identify patients with suspected COVID-19 findings, ultimately resulting in seven additional diagnoses and prompt initiation of PPE and quarantine protocols. This suggests that even in the early stages of community spread, there may be a high rate of undetected disease and a much-higher-than-suspected Fig. 2 a A 62- year-old lady presented with subjective fevers, vomiting, and diarrhea. A chest radiograph was obtained to evaluate for etiology of fever, revealing bilateral, hazy, peripheral patchy grand glass opacities. b Lateral view chest radiograph of the same patient. c Chest radiograph two days after admission demonstrates increasing bilateral airspace opacities, with signs of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. d Chest radiograph four days after admission demonstrate an intubated patient with progressive lung involvement, bilateral consolidations with septal thickening, and florid ARDS population incidence than that established by RT-PCR, which has been suggested by other studies [13] [14] [15] . This is in part due to restrictive testing criteria, which would have excluded these patients without pulmonary symptoms. These patients present a unique risk to those at the point-of-care, as there is low suspicion for COVID-19 at presentation, and therefore, the appropriate PPE precautions are not taken. Had these incidental imaging findings not been identified and correctly reported, or if these patients were not subsequently tested despite the reporting of suspicious imaging findings, these individuals may have continued to spread the infection to healthcare workers and within the community. This is highlighted by the two patients in this cohort who never developed symptoms who would have been sent home with a presumed negative COVID-19 diagnosis.',\n",
       " 'The rate of escalation to critical care, intubation, and mortality in this cohort was alarmingly high, suggesting these patients may have rapidly decompensated if sent home without a known diagnosis and possible lost to follow-up. Two patients were discharged to home quarantine for \"rule-out\" with a pending RT-PCR after initial suspicious imaging, who subsequently required admission and intubation. More research regarding which patients are at risk for rapid deterioration will be important to identify these patients.',\n",
       " 'This cohort identifies clinical findings that may be considered to be suspicious for COVID-19 infection in the absence of pulmonary or exposure history. Six out of seven (86%) of patients presented with abdominal complaints, consistent with an in-press publication suggesting nearly half of the patients in Hubei province of China endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms and that these patients had a more severe course of illness [16] . Classic pulmonary imaging findings in the absence of respiratory flu-like symptoms may increase the specificity for COVID-19 infection as the incidence of differential considerations (such as other respiratory viruses) is lower in this clinical context. COVID-19 in contrast is known to have an asymptomatic or sub-clinical period with positive chest CT findings [17] . Together, this may explain the high reported specificity of 88% in this small cohort of patients. Elevated inflammatory markers may be an important clinical correlate suggestive of a brewing COVID-19 infection, especially in the setting of leukopenia or a normal white blood cell count. Previous studies have shown that D-Dimer at the time of presentation may predict disease severity, which is concordant in this small cohort, with a markedly elevated D-Dimer range of 1396-3140 ng/mL among four patients, all of whom required eventual intubation and one of which expired during the admission [18] . These findings suggest that expansion of clinical suspicion beyond lower respiratory symptoms and exposure may be important to identify a larger proportion of infected patients and for appropriate triage and PPE at the point-ofcare.',\n",
       " 'Of note, five of the seven patients were seen in a health care setting within seven days of infection for an unrelated complaint, suggesting a possibility of nosocomial spread. Studies from China have suggested rates of in-hospital transmission to be as high as 41% [6] .',\n",
       " 'The classic CT findings of COVID-19 include bilateral, round, ground glass opacities in a peripheral distribution, \"crazy paving\", and vascular engorgement [7, 19, 20] . Unlike other viral pneumonias which primarily affect the airway resulting in tree-in-bud nonduality in a bronchial distribution, COVID-19 affects the Type II pneumocyte and results in a unique CT appearance that lends increased specificity [21] . Emerging literature has shown that the initially reported rates of sensitivity may have been underestimated, with [9, 10] . In a recent study of over 1000 patients, CT resulted in higher sensitivity in detection of SARS-COV2 as compared with initial RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab samples [22] . Reported positive predictive values were upwards of 60%. Additional studies are emerging that further solidify this positive predictive value, with reports now uncovering a cohort of patients with high-suspicion CT and false-negative initial PCRs later discovered to have positive, concordant COVID-19-positive PCR [23, 24] . It remains to be seen how patients with positive cross-sectional imaging in the setting of high clinical suspicion, especially in the absence of other etiologies (for example, negative respiratory viral panel), should be managed, until higher rates of RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity are confirmed. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground-glass opacity and may demonstrate normal findings, especially in the early stages of infection [19] . Bilateral peripheral, multifocal consolidations may be seen. Those in the late stage may present with findings of \"white lung\" and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, suggestion of COVID-19 on chest radiograph resulted in subsequent positive testing in two patients, which raises the question of whether there may be a role for radiography as a supplement to RT-PCR, or in areas where laboratory testing may be especially scarce.',\n",

We also estimated the SARS-CoV-2 infected TB patients with mild-moderate disease and severe disease, both in event of public health interventions and their absence respectively. TB patients in developing countries are likely to be undernourished (low BMI) with a weakened immune system which might predispose to superadded infections even in those patients initiated on DOTS but in the early treatment stages. 15 The TB patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing severe disease and may become critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation. 4 Even with the implementation of public health interventions, we observed there could be 11066 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB patients with severe disease. There are evidences that 62% of the critically ill patients and 81% of the patients requiring mechanical ventilation had succumbed to death. 16 Our The strength of our study is that we used SEIR model to estimate the number of infected patients with COVID-19 which will help the policy makers to design effective public health strategies to control the epidemic.

       " 'Highlights 1) What is the primary question addressed by this study? How can clinicians help older patients maintain social health during social distancing restrictions for COVID-19?',\n",
       " 'Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. Mental health clinicians with the skills to deliver the cognitive behavioral treatments to older adults described here should be active members of multidisciplinary teams mobilized to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and limit its impact on the older population.',\n",
       " 'Around the country, mental health clinics are forced to convert from face-to-face models of care to virtual ones. We are accustomed to seeing patients in distress, but never have we all been affected and distressed by the same experience, as with the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " \"Utilizing the cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness presented in this paper and developing ‗Connections Plans' provides clinicians with evidence-informed lessons gleaned from studies conducted by the HOPE Lab. Most clinicians are not taught ways to reach out to people virtually and are unfamiliar with using only verbal communication to express ourselves and offer comfort. While clinicians may feel uncomfortable with this approach to providing psychotherapy, it is also true that older adults report high satisfaction with psychotherapy provided by telephone and demonstrate high retention rates. 47 Creating a Connections Plan may help clinicians new to providing psychotherapy remotely because it is feasible and easy to implement over the phone, taking techniques that we already utilize, but putting them together in a straight-forward way that all clinicians can implement. For important issues to consider and practical guidance related to providing telephone psychotherapy, we refer readers to papers by Brenes and colleagues 47 and Mozer and colleagues. 48 Another useful resource is a guide to implementing Safety Planning with older adults, which includes tips for motivating patients and managing issues such as vision impairment and cognitive impairment when creating a Safety Plan, which is a similar strategy to a Connections Plan. 27, 49 The cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness as presented here illustrates effective applications of patient-centered care by mental health clinicians highlighting the value of knowing patient values and preferences. In times of ‗social distancing' access to health care professionals is also limited which, in turn, limits opportunities for practicing the skills and reinforcing the patient's adherence to the ‗Connections Plan.' Expanding support for the patient's plan, as described in the case examples which enlisted family involvement, would increase the likelihood of successful implementation. In addition, teaching family members the principles of the cognitive behavioral model would similarly empower them to comfort and reassure the patient during times of distress. For patients with limited family support and who may have been isolated prior to COVID-19, clinicians will have fewer resources to draw upon when creating a Connections Plan. In those instances, clinicians may need to emphasize distress tolerance strategies and helping the patient find ways of feeling safe and comforted without other people. The title, ‗Connections Plan' allows for many types of connections-with people, animals, nature, a higher purpose-and all of those connections have value. The importance of connections with people who are not close family and friends -‗weak or peripheral ties' in the social network-should not be discounted, as these connections are strongly linked with more positive mood in older adults. 50 Waving to neighbors, writing letters to individuals in nursing homes, or signing up for an intergenerational pen pal program, can be powerful ways to connect and improve mood. For older adults residing in nursing homes, clinicians can emphasize opportunities for connections with staff during daily care routines.\",\n",

       " \"As soon as the scale of the coronavirus shock to the economy became clear, the UK government introduced three policies to protect directly household incomes: a Job Retention Scheme, to pay the wages of employees who were temporarily furloughed; a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, to give grants to established self-employed people whose businesses had been affected; and a package of increases to entitlements to social security benefits, with Universal Credit at the core, that bolstered the UK's means-tested 'safety net'.

       " \"So far, it seems that a bottom-heavy labour market hit has not translated into as bottom-heavy a hit to family incomes, partly due to the success of the (strengthened) social security safety net in cushioning the blow-at least to some extent, and for some-and partly because many at the bottom of the income distribution are unaffected by job loss. On the other hand, looking at wider measures of living standards reveals a more concerning picture, with those in (precrisis) lower-income families being far more likely to have taken on new debt, or borrowed from friends or family, or cut back on saving; this reflects not that the income falls have been greater than among higher-income households but that they have been less likely to have experienced a (probably enforced) reduction in spending. This, in addition to evidence on people's assessments of their own situation, suggests that the crisis is having more marked negative effects on the living standards-considered broadly-of lower-income working-age families than of higher-income families. Furthermore, this comes after several years where incomes have grown very slowly at the bottom of the income distribution, particularly measuring incomes after housing costs have been deducted (Bourquin et al., 2020) .\",\n",

The CT scan showed improvement as evidenced by absorption of the lung opacities. Additionally, the blood tests results were normal. These findings indicate that the patient's positive nucleic acid test result after hospital discharge was not likely due to relapse; instead, it was more likely due to incomplete clearance of the virus. The nucleic acid test results on the patient's throat swabs were alternately negative and positive, which may be related to factors such as the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing or insufficient virus collection in throat swabs.\",\n",

The virus was likely more slowly removed because of her impaired autoimmunity. Additionally, whether the use of levothyroxine can cause false-positive results is unclear.\",\n",
       " \"COVID-19 obviously injuries the patient's lung, and in TCM, the throat is the portal to the lungs. Therefore, throughout the entire respiratory tract with the exception of the lungs, coronavirus accumulates primarily in the throat; this is why many patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice have been found to have coughs caused by throat itching. However, a simple chest radiograph or throat swab nucleic acid test is not enough to determine whether the virus has been completely removed. The throat swab test results cannot truly reflect the amount of virus present in the throat and the lungs. During treatment, the virus may be controlled and significantly reduced or removed from the upper respiratory tract; however, this does not mean that the virus in the lower respiratory tract has also been completely removed, but only that it cannot be detected through throat swab tests. Similarly, the coronavirus may affect the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] If underlying diseases affecting any of these five viscera are present, virus removal will be more difficult.\",\n",
       " 'Judging the condition of the lungs from the throat swab is in accordance with the TCM theory that the throat is the portal to the lungs.

       " 'To avoid false-negative and false-positive results, coronavirus antibody tests should also be performed. Antibodies can be used to determine whether coronavirus IgM and IgG antibodies are present in the body. IgG is a protective antibody that is produced 2 weeks after infection with the virus. Its production continues for a long time, and the antibody may be carried for life; its presence indicates infection with the virus. A higher IgG value indicates a higher amount of antibodies in the patient and stronger resistance to the virus. When both IgM and IgG are negative, no infection is present or no antibodies have been produced; when both are positive, the patient has recently been infected and viruses are present in the body. When IgM is negative and IgG is positive, the patient has produced antibodies, is within the rehabilitation period, and is very safe.',\n",
       " 'When our patient was first discharged from the hospital, the negative nucleic acid test result might have been false-negative. The virus might have been controlled at a low level, making it difficult to collect from the throat. Before the protective antibodies were produced, the discontinuation of treatment may have contributed to a comeback of the virus. The positive result of the nucleic acid test on the throat swab on 8 March basically ruled out the false-positive result, as assisted by the results of two nucleic acid tests from throat swabs on 17 and 20 March and viral antibody tests on 17 March ( Table 1) . Instead of resurgence, the virus was in fact still present. According to the explanation of positive test results in recovered patients with COVID-19 by academician Lanjuan Li in an interview, a small amount of residual virus remained in the deep regions of the lung, suggesting that TCM care such as Chinese herbal decoction, acupuncture and moxibustion, and Chinese Tuina massage during the rehabilitation period is also important. Our patient was first discharged from the hospital according to the discharge standards at that time; these standards were based on consecutive negative nucleic acid test results together with remarkable alleviation of respiratory symptoms, a decrease in body temperature, and improvement of chest CT results. The throat swab test is convenient and therefore very common. However, an anal test and virus antibody test should be considered in future because such tests may help to rule out positive cases among discharged patients. In particular, if IgM is negative and IgG is positive in a discharged patient with COVID-19, then protective antibodies have been produced and centralized isolation is not needed; this may greatly reduce medical costs.',\n",
       " 'The basic reproductive number -R 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Nevertheless, estimating R 0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R 0 . Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R 0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R 0 ) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R 0 when predicting epidemic size.',\n",
       " 'The network approach naturally accounts for heterogeneity, meaning that some individuals will cause more infections than others. The network approach also accounts for stochasticity explicitly: Even with R 0 > 1, there is a probability 1 − R(∞) that patient zero lies outside of the giant outbreak and therefore only leads to a small outbreak that does not invade the population.',\n",
       " 'However, the analysis in terms of PGFs is obviously more involved than simply assuming mass-action mixing and solving Eq. (1). In fact, the PGF G 0 (x) requires a full distribution of secondary cases per primary case, which will in practice involve a polynomial of high order.',\n",
       " 'To clarify and potentially simplify the approach, we propose to reformulate the classic network model in terms of the cumulant generating function (CGF) of secondary cases. The CGF K(y) of a random variable X can be written as K(y) = κ n y n /n! where κ n are the cumulants of the distribution of secondary infections. These are useful because the cumulants are easier to interpret, i.e., κ 1 is simply the average number of secondary cases R 0 , κ 2 is the underlying variance, κ 3 is related to the skewness and κ 4 to the kurtosis of the full distribution. By definition, a PGF G(x) of a random variable is linked to K(y) through G(x) = exp [K (ln x)]. Therefore, we can replace the PGF G 1 (x) for the distribution of secondary infections by a function in terms of the cumulants of that distribution. ',\n",
       " 'From re-emerging pathogens like yellow fever and measles to emerging threats like MERS-CoV and Ebola, the World Health Organization monitored 119 different infectious disease outbreaks in 2019 alone [26] . For each of these outbreaks, predicting both the epidemic potential and the most likely number of cases is critically important for responding efficiently and effectively. This need for rapid situation awareness is why R 0 is so widely used in public health. However, our main analysis, and Eq. (11) in particular, show that not only is R 0 insufficient in fully determining the final size of an outbreak, but having a larger outbreak with a lower R 0 is relatively easy considering the randomness associated with most transmission events and the heterogeneity of physical contacts. To address the need for rapid quantification of risk, while acknowledging the shortcomings of R 0 , we use network science methods to derive both the probability of an epidemic and its final size.',\n",
       " 'However, these results are not without important caveats. Specifically, we must remember that distributions of secondary cases, just like R 0 itself, are just as much a product of a pathogen as of the population in which it spreads. For example, aspects of the social contact network [27] , metapopulation structure [28, 29] , mobility [30, 31] , adaptive behavior [32, 33] , higher-order contact structure [34, 35] , and even other pathogens [36, 37] , all interact to cause complex patterns of disease emergence, spread, and persistence. Therefore, great care must be taken when using any of these tools to compare outbreaks or to inform current events with past data.',\n",
       " 'Three types of data could potentially be used in real time to improve predictions by considering secondary case heterogeneity. First, contact tracing data whose objective is to identify people who may have come into contact with an infectious individual. While mostly a preventive measure to identify cases before complications, it directly informs us about potential secondary cases caused by a single individual, and therefore provides us with an estimate for G 1 (x). Both for generating accurate predictions of epidemic risk and controlling the outbreak, it is vital to begin contact tracing before numerous transmission chains become widely distributed across space [38, 39] Second, viral genome sequences provide information on both the timing of the outbreak [40] [41] [42] and structure of secondary cases [43] [44] [45] . For example, methods exist to reconstruct transmission trees for sampled sequences using simple mutational models to construct a likelihood for a specific transmission tree [46, 47] and translate coalescent rates into key epidemiological parameters [48] [49] [50] . Despite the potential for genome sequencing to revolutionize outbreak response, the global public health community still struggles to coordinate data sharing across international borders, between academic researchers, and with private companies [51] [52] [53] .',\n",
       " 'Third, and most often the first available real time information on novel pathogens, are data related to similar past outbreaks. For example, in Fig. 2 we make a range of predictions for the final size of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan based on R 0 estimates from early cases [18, 19] and for the underlying distribution of secondary cases by analogy with the severe acute respiratory syndrome in similar population [13] . Based on this uncertainty, we obtain a range of final outbreak size (given as a fraction of the total susceptible population) between 5% and 40%. Critically, this large range stems from uncertainty in the heterogeneity of secondary infections. If the heterogeneity is large, sustained transmission is mostly maintained by so-called \"super-spreading\" events, then the outbreak is both more likely to end stochastically, less likely to spread extensively, as well as easier to manage with contact tracing, screening and infection control [24] . With less heterogeneity, the outbreak almost certainly cannot be contained and we must prepare for a pandemic of 2019-nCoV [54, 55] . Clearly, we are in dire need of contact tracing data and/or high-resolution pathogen genome surveillance for this outbreak.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, we reiterate that when accounting for the full distribution of secondary cases caused by an infected individual, there is no direct relationship between R 0 and the size of an outbreak. We also stress that both R 0 and the full secondary case distribution are not properties of the disease itself, but instead set by properties of the pathogen, the host population and the context of the outbreak. Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts. Altogether, predicting outbreak size based on early data is an incredibly complex challenge but one that is increasingly within reach due to new mathematical analyses and faster communication of public health data.',\n",
       " \"The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 ± 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis.

       " \"The Covid-19 pandemic seems at present to be unstoppable, effecting countries all over the world. Although Italy is facing this extremely stressful situation with all the available weapons and tools, severe concern has arisen regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to take the brunt of any subsequent psychosocial and economic implications. To this purpose, recent data highlighted that a significant proportion of the Italian general population may have moderate-to-severe psychological distress during the early phases of the Covid-19 emergency (18) .\",\n",
       " 'In line with this evidence, baseline findings of the PsyCOVID study suggest that Covid-19 will represent a psychosocial catastrophe. On the one side, healthcare workers face the emergency not only at the physical level, as they are continuously exposed to the contagion and engaged in patient assistance and care, but they have to cope with a huge psychosocial burden. This requires healthcare professionals to put into play enormous resources to adapt themselves to the new dystopic situation, managing the increasing distress while trying to bring out the most effective coping strategy. On the other side, quarantine and other social distancing measures imposed by Italian authorities to the majority of the population can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and lack of connectedness in socially fragile individuals, as well as enhance the risk of negative mental health outcomes (8) .',\n",
       " 'As with the SARS outbreak (19, 20) , persistent psychological symptoms will affect healthcare personnel and outbreak survivors, families of affected patients, quarantined fragile individuals, and socially disadvantaged sub-populations (i.e., subjects affected by chronic disease, elderly population with mild cognitive impairments, aged people without close relatives). However, literature reports only a few studies investigating psychological variables related to the Covid-19 spread. Wang and co-workers (21) provided evidence of a moderate to severe psychological impact of the outbreak in more than half of Chinese respondents, with 16.5% of interviewed individuals having moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 28.8% moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 8.1% moderate to severe stress levels. Li et al. (22) reported selfcontrol as a resilience factor potentially mitigating the perceived severity of the Covid-19 outbreak and mental health problems. Moccia and colleagues reported that the mental health burden due to the Covid-19 outbreak may be predicted by temperament and adult attachment style (8) .',\n",
       " 'Here we provided a first look at the psychosocial effects that the Covid-19 outbreak is having in Italy, in the very first days after the Italian Government Decree #iorestoacasa of March 9, 2020. Our results about the perceived impact of the Covid-19 The table illustrates group comparisons on psychosocial variables assessed, taking into account professional status (A) and geographic area (B). For each group we report mean and standard deviation. Statistical significance at p < 0.05 is indicated with (*) for group comparisons based on professional status and with ( §) for group comparisons based on geographic area. outbreak suggest that while the economy emergency is viewed as equally serious in all Italian regions and in both healthcare and non-healthcare workers, the health emergency is tightly linked to the professional status and the geographical spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. As expected, healthcare workers who have to deal with suffering and deaths day by day judged the health emergency as more serious than people not involved in Covid-19 patients assistance and care. At the same time, individuals living in Northern Italy-who are dramatically facing illness and suffering of close relatives and friends-felt the health emergency as more urgent than what individuals living in Central and Southern regions did.',\n",
       " \"Notably, we provided evidence that the severity of perception of the Covid-19 emergency reflected the individuals' psychosocial vulnerability. First, increased perceived social support (i.e., a low degree of loneliness) was significantly correlated to the increased perception of the Covid-19 impact on health. This suggests that the greater an individual's support network, is the worse (i.e., more serious) his/her judgment about the Covid-19 consequences for health will be. In other terms, having more people in our own social network increases the probability to have examples of positive or probable cases in mind [feeding the so-called representativeness heuristic (23) ] and, thus, to consider the current emergency as more serious. This is particularly true for healthcare professionals who are continuously and physically in touch with patients and colleagues. However, such a relationship is mediated by perceived distress, contributing to nearly half of the total effect of loneliness on the perception of the Covid-19 impact on health.\",\n",
       " \"Model 2 highlighted that better empathic skills (i.e., how much better I can understand others' emotions and point of view) are related to a more serious perception of the Covid-19 impact on the economy. Such a result indicates that a profound understanding of what the restrictive measures mean for Italian entrepreneurs and organizations generates a more serious judgment of the impact of Covid-19 on the Italian economy. Interestingly, we observed that a third of the effect is mediated by problem-oriented coping strategies. This indicates that a way of facing problems based on active strategies, planning, and focused efforts towards problem resolution makes people more aware of the imminent crisis and gets them prepared to face the economic disaster (e.g. industrial conversion of activities to produce goods currently in high demand). Interestingly, a previous report on the psychosocial impact of global infection outbreaks, including the SARS and the West Nile Virus, showed that the perceived threat of these diseases were related with different coping strategies, also including empathic responding (24) . In particular, the authors underlined that empathic responding is associated to an individual engagement in recommended health precautions and in the avoidance of behaviors entailing detrimental social and economical consequences. In this light, more empathic individuals may also display a higher adherence to the imposed measures, in order to prevent the contagion spread.\",\n",
       " \"Crucially, psychosocial variables here investigated represent modifiable factors. The scientific literature provides a large range of intervention strategies and programs for each single domain (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Of course, the day-by-day accurate reporting of the status of the epidemic and experts' opinion guidance on prevention and infection control play important roles in stabilizing people and overcoming the epidemic-related crisis. Actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control can help to alleviate social anxiety and the feeling of helplessness and strengthen the sense of membership to a large community despite the physical distance and isolation due to restrictive measures. However, real-time updates of information on outbreak effects without more hopeful news to counteract this could be detrimental in the long time. This is the reason why, in such a catastrophic context, there is an urgent need to develop evidence-driven and multi-faceted intervention strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychosocial distress during, and especially after, the Covid-19 outbreak. Comparably, consensus guidelines to orient physicians, psychologists, and other mental care professionals toward an effective unified approach are urgent. The present work provides important suggestions that may help in defining new intervention programs. Our data, indeed, might help the government and health authorities to evaluate how and where to allocate resources in the future, including personnel, services, care facilities, and interventions, to manage the situation in the coming months and years.\",\n",
       " \"Some criticisms in this report have to be underlined. First, we collected data via a self-administered survey, and thus possible issues might be related to recall bias and the intrinsic limitations of self-report measures. Secondly, the convenience sampling might have affected the generalizability of the present findings, as the sample cannot be considered actually representative of the Italian population. Another limitation is related to the crosssectional nature of our report, which prevents the observation of changes of participants' perceptions of the Covid-19 impact over time. However, we are going to overcome such an issue by reporting longitudinal data after the planned follow-up assessment, once all the socially restrictive measures in Italy will definitively end. Moreover, we have to underline that, despite having confirmed our initial predictions by showing that the perceived impact of Covid-19 on health and the economy is affected by different psychosocial predictors, including distress and loneliness as well as empathic and coping abilities, there was the possibility that the opposite is also true. Further studies can address such a specific issue. Finally, future analyses will also benefit from taking into account the socio-economic status of participants, a variable that may be crucial to better understand individual differences in perceptions and psychosocial profiles.\",\n",

Our data teaches us the need to invest in preparedness to prevent, rapidly identify, and contain mid-and long-term consequences of global health emergency outbreaks such as Covid-19. Although reacting with travel bans and quarantines costs effort and economic resources and impacts on the well-being of millions of individuals cordoned off in a zone of contagion, it is reasonably necessary to contain further disasters. The psychological weight of thousands of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases and of huge numbers of deaths is difficult to bear without a known successful scenario. People are suffering from the weight of having a limited access to social or psychological support, as well as from not seeing a future constructive outlook. In this view, big data analyses should analyze public health risks in the future in order to adjust health care strategies that could be implemented for any future crisis. We all need to move in this direction in order to understand and control the disease now and its effects later. Memories of the numbers of affected and diseased people will probably wane but psychosocial consequences will last. This modern war has just begun.',\n",

Regression analyses show that those who have or had COVID-19-related symptoms are more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and are lonelier.

       " \"The new outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus termed 'COVID-19' has emerged as a serious global public health concern. 32 The illness was first announced on 31 December 2019, 33, 34 and the rapid spread of the virus is fueling fears of a global pandemic. 35 During the initial period of the outbreak, from 8 December to 21 January 425 cases were identified, with a growing number of cases not linked to the Huanan seafood market. 1 The number of cases reported and documented from the declaration of the initial outbreak, to date, has grown exponentially. At the time of writing, there are now 42 820 cases of COVID-19, with 1014 deaths, and the virus has spread to >26 countries.\",\n",
       " \"COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. 36 Coronaviruses are zoonotic and are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as MERS and SARS. 21 Initially, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan reported some link to a large seafood and live-animal market, suggesting zoonotic transmission. Scientists also believe that an animal source is 'the most likely primary source', and human-to-human transmission has occurred, with growing numbers of cases reportedly without exposure to animal markets. 3 Early in the outbreak, a top Chinese government-appointed expert stated a mysterious respiratory illness had killed at least four people with evidence of human-to-human transmission, heightening public concern. 36,37 It is likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, and similarities can be drawn more closely to SARS than MERS, because of the virus' rapid rate of infection. 38 When person-to-person spread occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how other respiratory pathogens spread. 12, 29 This is the same hypothesized mechanism of transmission for COVID-19. The spread of MERS and SARS between people has generally occurred between close contacts, similar to the current epidemic in China. According to the WHO, common signs of COVID-19 infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death. 39 The WHO has advised avoidance of 'unprotected' contact with live animals, to thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Additionally, the CDC issued a travel statement to avoid all non-essential travel to China (Level 3 Travel Notice). 40 Control measures have been put into effect, although the timing of these measures and the relatively rapid spread of the current virus suggests that lessons from the previous SARS and MERS epidemics were not heeded.\",\n",
       " \"The surge in infections is alarming due to increased international travel around the Lunar New Year (25 January) and Chinese business ties across the globe. Researchers should critically review the virus' genome sequence to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, incubation period, modes of transmission, the common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that go undetected. Risk assessment is badly needed to control the impact of the virus. This risk assessment should include an evaluation of the current standard of epidemiologic surveillance and identifying the risk factors for human-to-human transmission from asymptomatic cases.\",\n",
       " 'Since there is no specific treatment for coronaviruses, 39 there is an urgent need for global surveillance of humans infected with COVID-19. The combined role of internet of things (IoT) and related technologies can play a vital role in preventing the spread of zoonotic infectious diseases. Smart disease surveillance systems could enable simultaneous reporting and monitoring, end-to-end connectivity, data assortment and analysis, tracking and alerts. Remote medical assistance should also be adopted to detect and control zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'Airport authorities around the globe must take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19. Urgent actions such as screening air passengers traveling from China are needed to contain the spread of suspected COVID-19 cases. Patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases must be reported to the authorities. After further investigation, travelers that are symptomatic or fit the case definition for the novel coronavirus need to be sent to local hospitals for further management. However, this may prove difficult due to the asymptomatic nature of some cases. Wuhan alone has connections with more than 60 overseas destinations through its international airport, whereas Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, all of which have reported cases, have hundreds more. Furthermore, airport authorities should also display alerts on the signs and symptoms of the virus, and preventive measures should be taken by travelers around the globe.',\n",
       " 'In order to halt the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, affected countries should look to past successes and failures of beta-coronavirus spread. Lessons learned from the MERS and SARS outbreaks can provide valuable insight into how to handle the current epidemic. These include proper hand hygiene, isolation of infected individuals in properly ventilated hospitals (negative pressure rooms), isolation of individuals with suspected symptoms or fever, and preventing direct contact with suspected animal reservoir hosts. Unfortunately, some lessons were not heeded. Transparency was lacking between government officials and the public, which in turn led to the rapid spread of the virus. In contrast, the rapid sharing of the genetic sequencing of the virus has led to faster diagnoses on a global scale. The Chinese government was also able to quickly build hospitals in order to house the infected, although these steps came too late to prevent the spread. The top concern of health officials now should be halting the spread of the infection. Thus far, >40 000 people have been infected, with no end in sight to the epidemic. Basic epidemiological parameters of patients including person, place and time of diagnosis, as well as clinical signs and symptoms, outcome of the infection, severity, exposures and travel histories must be ascertained for each case. The role that live-animal markets have played in the SARS and COVID-19 epidemics highlight the need for a paradigm shift in China away from their use. Closure or suspension of these markets would be the most conservative approach to preventing zoonotic transmission, however China has a long history of live markets, and their permanent ban is unlikely. In this case, the use of proper hygiene and protocols for limiting animal-to-human contact would be ideal, as well as increased epidemiologic surveillance and monitoring. More research should be carried out on the development of effective methods to provide early and timely detection of such diseases. These methods have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of IoT technologies for mapping the spread of infection. Necessary effective measures need to be taken to avoid the unpredictable risk of continuing outbreaks in China and the possibility of a local outbreak turning into a global pandemic.

Comités scientifiques En France, alors qu'un conseil scientifique présidé par le professeur Jean-François Delfraissy (président, par ailleurs, du Comité Consultatif National d'Éthique) existe depuis le 12 mars [1] un second comité a été institué le 24 mars : le CARE (Comité analyse, recherche et expertise) [2]. Cette nouvelle instance comprend 12 chercheurs et médecins, et a pour charge de conseiller le gouvernement sur les traitements et les tests à mettre en oeuvre contre le Covid-19. Ce comité est présidé par le professeur Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, virologue à l'Institut Pasteur, directrice de recherche émérite à l'INSERM, et lauréate du prix Nobel de médecine en 2008 pour son rôle dans la découverte du VIH. Ces deux instances ont donc uniquement un rôle consultatif vis-à-vis des autorités politiques, et cette fonction trouve place dans un contexte très tendu en France -comme dans toute l'Europe, où le pic de l'épidémie n'a pas encore été atteint partout. Déjà épuisés, et sachant, par le modèle italien, la gravité des cas à venir dans un temps très proche, les soignants réclament déjà à l'exécutif un confinement total pour limiter au maximum la crise sanitaire. Saisi en urgence, le Conseil d'État s'est prononcé contre cette mesure dans sa décision du 22 mars [3]. Risque psychologique du confinement Mais ce confinement, même incomplet, n'est pas sans risque, notamment chez les populations vulnérables, en situation de dépendance, pour lesquelles il sera bien plus difficile à vivre (ou survivre ?) à cette crise.

       " 'Under the global health emergency caused by coronavirus disease 2019 , efficient and specific therapies are urgently needed. Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in the past few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptorbinding domain (RBD) are compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes. The current COVID-19 antibody clinical trials, which are not limited to the S protein target, are also reviewed.',\n",
       " 'Currently, developing effective therapies for combating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes a vital task for human health and the world economy. Although designing new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs is of paramount importance, traditional drug discovery might take many years. Effective vaccines typically require more than a year to develop. Therefore, a more efficient strategy in fighting against COVID-19 is to look for antibody therapies, which is a relatively easier technique compared to the development of small-molecular drugs or vaccines. Seeking possible antibody drugs has attracted increasing attention in recent months. Moreover, complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which located in the tip of the antibody, determine the specificity of antibodies and make the antibody therapies a promising way to fight against COVID-19. We analyze the structure, function, and therapeutic potential of seven SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody candidates that have three-dimensional (3D) structures available in the Protein Data Bank. In a comparative study, we also review five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) complexes with both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins. The multiple order of magnitude discrepancies in reported experimental binding affinities motivates us to carry a systematic computational analysis of the aforementioned fourteen complexes. Using computational topology, machine learning, and wide class network models, we put all of the complexes in an equal footing to evaluate binding and interactions. Additionally, we have predicted binding affinities of five SARS-CoV antibodies when they are used as SARS-COV-2 therapies. Finally, we summarize all of the currently ongoing clinical antibody trails for SARS-CoV-2, which have many targets, including the S protein.

The systemic inflammatory response, which is particularly excessively elevated in COVID-19, can also result in kidney injury and impair sodium and water metabolism, which may precipitate the worsening of HF. 12 Recent studies on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 infection have reported that ACE2 levels are 50% higher in male patients with HF.

The presented cases indicate the impact of routine LUS after an obstetric US examination on the clinical outcome and treatment of pregnant women. To the best of our knowledge, this article provides the largest case series so far regarding the use of LUS on pregnant women. Chest CT is now considered an essential tool for the diagnosis and management of the SARS-CoV-2. 2, 11 Although a single chest radiograph causes radiation exposure as low as about 0.1 mSv, it has been found to be insensitive in mild, early, and late phases of COVID-19 infection. 16, 17 Several centers have a low threshold for the use of low-dose CT as a screening test for COVID-19, and some screen all patients who have been admitted to the hospital. 16 However, a recent consensus statement from the multinational Fleischner Society emphasized that the use of CT should be assessed in detail, considering the severity of the disease, pretest probability, risk factors of the individual for clinical progression, and local resource limitations. 17 The society did not recommend the use of CT or chest radiography as a screening test in asymptomatic patients and mild symptomatic patients without progression. In addition, in limited-resource settings, chest radiography has been proposed to be preferred in lieu of CT for patients with mild symptoms.',\n",
       " 'Two affiliated tertiary and secondary hospitals recently published their novel results after initiation of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing for all patients admitted to the labor unit regardless of their triage based on the history and their symptoms. 18 Almost one-third of all pregnant women (32.6%), in fact, have been found to be asymptomatic on presentation to the labor unit and had a diagnosis either after becoming symptomatic subsequently or after universal PCR testing for all obstetric admissions in a novel study from the United States. 18 Of those, 28.6% were still asymptomatic over the course of their admission or early after postpartum discharge. The same group published their extended results of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 in a labor ward with 215 pregnant women. 19 A high percentage (88% [n = 29 of 33]) of pregnant women with COVID-19 were asymptomatic on admission. Overall, 13.5% of the pregnant women who were admitted to the labor unit had no symptoms related to COVID-19 and were found to be test positive.

Treatment should be considered in cases with risk factors or severe clinical progress. 15 However, those recommendations may not be relevant for a specific vulnerable population: pregnant women. Although exposure to a low level of ionizing radiation by chest imaging during pregnancy is considered relatively safe, this can be a major source of anxiety for many pregnant women and their health care providers. 21 Pregnant women are also regarded as a high-risk group along with people who are immunocompromised, with underlying end-organ dysfunction, who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and who are 65 years and older. 17, 18 In this series, 3 women who refused chest imaging because of the potential risks to the fetus and breast were admitted with mild symptoms.

Encouragingly, daily surveillance with bedside LUS examinations performed by an obstetrician verified the lack of improvement in imaging findings and therefore contributed to the decision for delivery. 22 The authors postulated that LUS has value in monitoring the clinical progress of pregnant women in terms of either a decision to expedite delivery or upgrade the medical treatment. In patient 3 of this series, the point-of-care LUS led to a suspicion of severe lung involvement and the need for a second CT examination for monitoring.',\n",

Recently, the CLUE (COVID-19 lung ultrasound in emergency) protocol was suggested to be used in emergency medicine settings for stratifying patients suspected of having COVID-19 based on both the LUS findings and the supplemental oxygen requirement. 25 However, that protocol was based on scanning of the chest for 12 anatomic landmarks instead of 14, as used in our study. We had 2 mild cases, 5 moderate cases, and 1 critical case. Considering the LUS findings and the clinical severity of our cases, we can suggest that pregnant women with LUS scores of less than 8 can be regarded as mild, between 8 and 15 as moderate, between 16 and 24 as severe, and greater than 24 as critical.

We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. Methods We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine has garnered unprecedented attention as a potential therapeutic option in the global COVID-19 pandemic. 39 Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown data that may support its possible efficacy, but clinical data are limited to small clinical trials and uncontrolled case series and cohorts. 20 There is an urgent need for the rigorous evaluation of hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic option against COVID-19. 40 This innovative trial is adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and its ability to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. The novel web-based design of this trial, in the setting of a highly contagious global pandemic, has ensured that all interactions with participants, including enrolment and informed consent, are done remotely using courier services to deliver medicine and using internetbased follow-up. This will allow compliance with strict social distancing strategies and reduce risks of infectious spread to study personnel and others. The design encourages large scale enrolment to ensure the target number of participants are enrolled and trial results are obtained as quickly as possible. Importantly, the design was finalized, regulatory and REB approvals were obtained, and large geographic jurisdictions brought online in an unprecedently short duration (within a few weeks of a global pandemic) with a goal to obtain the maximal information in the minimal amount of time.',\n",
       " 'Recently, several public figures have promoted the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in the absence of robust scientific data. 39, 41 This trial will help address if large scale dissemination of hydroxychloroquine is appropriate in certain populations. Importantly, if this study shows a positive effect, this will support a new therapeutic option to mitigate the global spread and impact of COVID-19. If a null or negative effect is shown, this will reduce the risk of harm to future patients, reduce healthcare expenditures due to ineffective medications, and protect the drug supply for patients with previously established indications for hydroxychloroquine. The results of this trial will be instrumental in determining if hydroxychloroquine may play an important role in mitigating the global impact of COVID-19. ',\n",

       " \"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to respiratory epithelium through the ACE2 receptor, an endogenous receptor for Angiotensin II (AngII). The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges, as the medical and scientific communities develop new therapies, new diagnostic tests, and new insights into the mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus acts. Studies of coronavirus-receptor interactions have implicated the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate in viral attachment to mammalian cells [1,2]. Recent work on the structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has provided detail about the glycosylations of the spike protein and interactions between the spike protein and carbohydrates [3,4]. Findings suggest potential for both proteincarbohydrate and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between the spike glycoprotein and cell receptors. A galectin-like fold identified in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggests potential binding with chondroitin sulfates, the preferred binding partners of galectins [5]. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated similar effects of heparin and chondroitin sulfates on binding with the spike glycoprotein and on conformational change in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) [6]. Heparin's ability to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 may be related to competition with chondroitin sulfates, since similar conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD follow treatment by chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S,CSA), chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S, CSC), dermatan sulfate (formerly CSB), and chondroitin sulfate D (chondroitin 2,6disulfate), as well as by heparin and heparan sulfate [6]. The galectin-like fold at the N-terminal domain of the spike protein is reported in other coronaviruses to bind with carbohydrates on cell surfaces as an initial step in viral entry [8]. Insertion of amino acids at the cleavage site between the S1/S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has created three potential GalNAc O-glycosylation sites [8], not previously predicted for the bat or pangolin virus [9]. Recent glycoproteomics data identify sulfation at the non-reducing end of HexNAc residues modifying amino acids of the spike protein, most notably at position 74 [10].

This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients' mortality. Methods: 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 93% or PaO2/FiO2<=300 mmHg. Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls. On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care. Results: Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered. The respiratory function resulted improved in 64.8% of the observations in tocilizumab patients who were still hospitalized, whereas 100% of controls worsened and needed mechanical ventilation.

A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. Setting: The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Participants: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. Interventions: TCZ was administered to 21 patients. The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. Results: There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years). Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin). No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration. This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC.

Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throatswab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. Methods/design: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up.

Early reports suggest a role for hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load. 32 However, the impact of hydroxychloroquine on the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients is largely unknown and highly debated. Even if hydroxychloroquine was safely used in our cohort, we cannot draw any conclusion regarding its efficacy because of the absence of a control group. The currently recruiting DISCOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials (NCT04315948 and NCT04321616, respectively) will provide some answers regarding treatment efficacy in the general population. The results of these trials will then need to be extrapolated to the kidney transplant recipients population. None of our patient received the antivirals currently in the pipeline 33 days after the tocilizumab administration. 15 In our cohort, the kidney function outcome was satisfactory. Although 28% of hospitalized patients experienced AKI, none required hemodialysis. Moreover, kidney function rapidly stabilized after appropriate hydration. To date, we have not observed any acute rejection episodes, but the current follow-up of our patients is short. As there is a correlation between immunosuppression reduction and increased risk of acute rejection 35 , appropriate monitoring of kidney function should be continued and reintroduction of immunosuppressive drugs should be tailored after infection recovery.',\n",

Management was not uniform as in our series, as immunosuppression reduction and hydroxychloroquine use was used in 86%, and patients also received Azithromycin (46%), the CCR5 inhibitor leronlimab (21%) and tocilizumab (7%). Interestingly, while kidney transplant recipients from this cohort seem quite similar to ours regarding co-morbidities, the outcome appears more severe with 11 kidney transplant recipients (39%) requiring mechanical ventilation and 6 (21%) requiring kidney replacement therapy. The mortality rate was also higher at the end of follow-up (28% vs 11% in our patients). A possible explanation might be the ethnic origin of the patients in that cohort, as 39% and 42% were black and Hispanic, respectively, which differs from our population.

The mechanism of action on viruses for these two medicines is likely the same effect. Chloroquine has been used for a long time to treat malaria and showed positive outcomes in patients. Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine showed a significant effectiveness to kill intracellar pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever (22) . The French open label, non-randomized clinical trial was promising and the first clinical trial of these medications in COVID-19 patients. The effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significant because it showed reduction in the viral load when it compared with the control group (22) . Moreover, the effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more potent when Azithromycin was added to the patients according to their clinical need. However, clinical follow-up and occurrence of adverse effects were not discussed in the paper; further work should be done on these medicines with the aim of reducing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 (57) (58) (59) . Although these two medicines have shown promising activity against SARSCoV-2, there is a risk of arrhythmia associated with their administration. Therefore caution is required for use at higher cumulative dosages. It is recommended that their use in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 is to be restricted to hospitalized patients.

In unadjusted analysis, admission to the ICU was associated with a greater than 10-fold odds of developing each arrhythmia ( Figure 2 ). All cardiac arrest patients had been admitted to the ICU on initial presentation and prior to the development of cardiac arrest. Further, after adjustment for age, sex, race, BMI, prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, and hydroxychloroquine treatment, ICU status remained independently associated with incident AF and NSVT; however, the odds for bradyarrhythmias was rendered nonsignificant (Figure 2 ). An increase in 1-year of age was associated with incident AF ( 2.52 -17.98]) but was attenuated to nonsignificance after multivariable analysis. No association was observed between bradyarrhythmias, NSVT and acute mortality (Figure 3 ).',\n",

The acute, in-hospital mortality rates in both our ICU population and the recent studies from New York are similar and slightly more than 20%. 6, 7 The cardiac arrest rate of 11% observed in our ICU population approximates the 13% cardiac arrest rate observed across New York. 6 The slightly higher rate in New York may be explained by combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin -medications that result in QT prolongation and independently increase the risk of cardiac arrest. 6 None of the patients in our center were treated with azithromycin. Our findings also expand on these initial observations by specifying that nearly all of the cardiac arrests in our COVID-19 population included non-shockable rhythms such as PEA or asystole. Only 1 case of torsades de pointes was present. We did not observe the burden of sustained VT/VF that was reported from the early experiences in Wuhan. 2, 3 Our findings support that non-cardiac causes such as systemic infection, inflammation and illness are likely to contribute more to the etiology of cardiac arrest than direct myocardial infection with or necrosis due to the viral infection. Further support is also provided by our study's non-ICU population of 621 patients, who had a much lower rate of acute mortality. No cardiac arrests were observed in this group, which comprised nearly 90% of our COVID-19 population.\",\n",

In China, drugs that were recommended were primarily HCQ but also α-interferon, lopinavir, ritonavir and umifenovir [27] , in Korea, recommended drugs were lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine [28] . In the context of a pandemic with a lethal respiratory virus, we believe that early detection of positive cases and carefully controlled treatment with safe and well-tolerated drugs should be generalized in outpatient medicine, i.e. in individuals with mild symptoms before signs of severity appear. Strict attention should be paid to contraindications and possible interactions with concomitant medication.

An overview of the factors associated with severe COVID-19 is shown in Figure 7 , summarizing the strong correlation with comorbidities and various forms of organ injury. Although the full clinical spectrum of COVID-19 severity is not currently known, several factors may contribute to the elevated risk associated with impaired organ function. First, SARS-CoV-2 can attack the wide range of organs and tissues that express the receptor protein ACE2 [34, 38] . Second, several chronic comorbidities, including hypertension, CVD, CKD, and diabetes, may render the affected organs and tissues susceptible to virus infection via an impaired immune response [74] . Third, certain antiviral drugs such as chloroquine [62] , ribavirin [63, 68] , and lopinavir/ritonavir [67] have side effects that can include organ damage. Fourth, acute respiratory distress syndrome-(ARDS-) induced hypoxia can promote damage in organs outside of the respiratory system [64, 75] .

The immunology-rheumatology and dermatology clinics were the highest prescribers of hydroxychloroquine in our cohort, which appeared to be relatively constant in March 2020 compared with the preceding 11-month period. Most prescriptions documented between March 24 and 31, 2020, were for continuation of ongoing therapy in these clinics, primarily with 90-day supplies, consistent with ongoing therapy.

Our data do not include nonelectronically documented prescriptions (eg, phone call or hand written) or whether documented prescriptions were filled, and the data were not adjusted for patient or encounter volume.

Besides ARDS and acute kidney injury, cardiovascular complications also represent a common consequence of the disease and, at the same time, a cause for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients. Although we cannot ignore emerging events of druginduced sudden cardiac death among treated COVID-19 patients (Chorin et al. 2020) , clinical reports well support careful evaluation of the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the onset of severe COVID-19 due to CVD following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include, for example, classical RAS pathway and ACE2, NLRP3/inflammasome, and hypoxemia (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the prevalence and death toll of COVID-19 increases with aging as well as frailty, and seems correlated with prolonged exposure to air pollution, both of which represent life-threatening CV risk factors.

With the extremely high speed and relatively high accuracy, our DFCNN model for 3C-like protease-ligand interaction analysis is suitable to overcome the challenge of screening tens of thousands of drugs in a short time in a certain emergency situations, such as 2019-nCov outbreak. Our deep learning model based on DFCNN is a data-driven model, which learns 3C-like protease-ligand interaction from known binding and nonbinder data. The model use the binding pocket of 3C-like protease-ligand conformation instead of whole conformation of the complex; hence our model is so fast and accurate compared to all other molecular docking procedures. The identified potential 3C-like protease-ligand pairs can be subjected to MD simulation to further check the binding stability and atomic interaction pattern, or even the binding free energy with techniques such as metadynamics to narrow down the candidate list.

       " 'There has been anecdotal evidence suggesting various drugs may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Prospective studies investigating initially touted agents such as Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin have failed to show whether Hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin can effectively alter the disease course in patients with severe COVID-19 (Taccone et al., 2020) . However, preliminary data analysis from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored randomized clinical trial (RCT) for Remdesivir involving patients with advanced COVID-19 suggested that patients who received Remdesivir had a significant 4-day difference in median time to recovery compared to those who received placebo (National Institutes of Health, 2020). Therefore, in-keeping with its commitment to expediting the development and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization on 1st May, 2020 for Remdesivir to be used for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 2020). The potential mortality benefit of Remdesivir is less clear, with a clinical trial from China showing no mortality benefit (Y. Wang et al., 2020) , and conclusive results from the NIH trial being awaited. Nevertheless, the preliminary results of the NIH trial suggest that the virus can be inhibited in vivo resulting in clinically meaningful outcomes. Despite this early success, many unanswered questions remain about Remdesivir including its availability, route of administration (exists only in intravenous form), cost, and indication for use in non-severe hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. For these reasons, additional therapeutic agents are needed in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

There is no definitive treatment, but the role of antivirals like remdesivir and lopinavir, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and passive immunization like convalascent plasma is being researched. Currently, the focus is on the prevention of disease by practicing social distancing until a vaccine is developed.

Pulmonary CT revealed bilateral multiple consolidation with bilateral pleural effusion. Aggressive weight reduction was needed to improve the patient's respiratory condition. Hemodialysis therapy was performed in isolation with hydroxychloroquine administration, but the formation of a dialysis membrane clot forced the withdrawal of dialysis therapy. Changing the dialysis membrane material and anticoagulant enabled the resumption of dialysis therapy, allowing the body weight to correct downward. On the 5th hospitalization day, the patient's fever dropped and he showed improved oxygenation and chest X-ray. He was eventually discharged. The hydroxychloroquine and appropriate fluid management may have contributed to the patient's recovery. Clinicians should pay close attention to avoid dialysis-related problems when treating a patient with COVID-19.\",\n",

The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

We found that circulating monocytes from COVID-19 patients exhibit a phenotype of enhanced activation. Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes by these cells associated with the development of more severe illness. We discovered that hydroxychloroquine can avert the induction of trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level, possibly through changes in the cellular lipidome.

The impact of the disease on prevalent general surgical practice is uncertain and continues to evolve. The study aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 on general surgical practice in India and the future implications of the pandemic. A survey questionnaire was designed and electronically circulated 1 month after India entered a national lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic, amongst members of Indian Association of Gastro-intestinal Endo-surgeons (IAGES), a surgical association with nearly eight thousand members from across the country. Survey questions pertaining to pre-COVID era surgical practices, impact on current practice, and financial implications were asked. Responses were collected and statistically analyzed. One hundred fifty-three surgeons completed the survey, of which only 9.2% were women. Majority (41%) were into practice for more than 20 years; 36.6% were into private practice at multiple hospitals (free-lancers). Amongst the respondents, 41.8% had mainly laparoscopic practice with mean outpatient consultation of 26 patients/day and elective surgeries of 43 cases/month prior to lockdown. Post-lockdown, daily outpatient consults reduced to 4 patients per day, and 77% had not performed a single elective procedure. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) chemoprophylaxis was reported by 52% surgeons. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was used by 52% for all cases, while 71.5% stated there are insufficient guidelines for future surgical practice in terms of safety. A drop of more than 75% of their monthly income was experienced by 52% surgeons, while 22% faced 50-75% reduction. One third (33%) of respondents own a hospital and are expecting a monthly financial liability of 2.25 million rupees (nearly 30,000 US dollars). COVID-19 has led to a drastic reduction in outpatient and elective surgical practices. There is a definite need for guidelines regarding safety for future surgical practices and solutions to overcome the financial liabilities in the near future.',\n",
       " 'Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the standard of care in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases and potentially for the treatment in COVID-19 patients. Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-highresolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices. Methods: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. Results: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. Conclusions: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.',\n",
       " 'To further evaluate the reproducibility in patient samples, the current protocol was modified to resemble the protocols of Mok et al. [20] and Soichot et al. [24] . Reproducibility for QC samples was satisfactory for all three protocols. However, none of the methods showed any significant improvement with respect to serum patient samples (CV 15-17%), compared to WB (3%). Previous methods for HCQ analysis using LC-MS have been evaluated using QC samples, and the reproducibility of patient samples was not evaluated [20, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Hydroxychloroquine is a drug with a plasma protein binding degree estimated to 50% [31] , and it has been speculated that WB is favorable because of the technical challenges in separating blood cells and platelets from plasma [32] .',\n",
       " 'These patients, who were on a stable dose of Plaquenil (> 6 months), and thus expected to have reached equilibrium concentrations [33, 34] , displayed HCQ levels in WB approximately twice the levels detected in both serum and plasma. This ratio is smaller compared to previous findings, reporting a WB-plasma ratio of approximately 5:1 [22] . Hydroxychloroquine concentrations vary considerably between individuals with the same dosing regimen. For example, in WB, there was up to 16-fold difference between individuals (2000 mg HCQ/week). This high inter-individual difference has also been reported by others [9, 12, 32] . There was also an up to 2.3-fold difference (in WB) between the occasions in patients that were sampled twice (n = 4), with no obvious connection to the time between sampling occasions (two at a 10-day interval and two at a 60-day interval). These observations point to the fact that HCQ concentrations cannot be predicted only based on the prescribed dose [13, 35] . The high stability of HCQ in WB, with no significant decrease in concentration after prolonged storage up to 168 h, allows for collection of samples and transportation without the need of cooling or freezing. Importantly, however, samples need to be frozen at -80°for 24 h followed by thawing to ensure hemolysis of red blood cells. Shorter freezing period at -80°may be sufficient, but has not been evaluated in the current study.',\n",
       " \"In this very limited size study, intended for the evaluation of most suitable matrix for the determination of HCQ, we found a significant association between the Fig. 2 Reproducibility testing. In order to evaluate the reproducibility of the method in the three matrices, eight patient samples were processed and analyzed on two occasions. a, b, and c shows the results for whole blood, serum, and plasma, respectively. Reproducibility was high in WB, intermediate in serum, and low in plasma patient's weekly dose and HCQ levels in WB, in contrast to serum or plasma levels. Other factors including age, gender, and genetically determined drug metabolism may also influence patients' HCQ levels in blood [12, 14] . Hydroxychloroquine measurements in routine care can help clinicians motivate patients to improve treatment adherence, and to accordingly adjust doses, avoiding unnecessary addition of potentially more toxic therapy. Monitoring HCQ concentrations could also help minimize the risk of long-term side effects such as retinopathy, as recently demonstrated that HCQ blood levels predicted later hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [16] . The optimal concentration levels to balance these aims may require further evaluation [19] .\",\n",

       " 'Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug being tested as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, it may serve as a potential prophylactic agent especially in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, household contacts of infected patients, and the immunocompromised. Our aim was to identify possible hydroxychloroquine dosing regimens through simulation in those at high risk of infections by optimizing exposures above the in vitro generated half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) and to help guide researchers in dose-selection for COVID-19 prophylactic studies. To maintain weekly troughs above EC 50 in > 50% of subjects at steady-state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or 3 times weekly is required. In an exposure driven, postexposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC 50 in > 50% subjects. These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.',\n",

Our aim was to optimize exposures above the in vitro generated EC 50 . 3 It is important to note that in vitro to in vivo extrapolations could either underestimate or overestimate actual drug requirements, however, they are a reasonable starting point in the absence of other data. Notably, therapeutic effect may be maintained even longer, as preclinical models have demonstrated up to 30-fold accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung tissue. 12 Similar to what has been proposed for treatment by other groups, 4,5 our simulations suggest higher treatment and prophylactic doses for COVID-19 may be needed than those recommended for malaria. This is consistent with the > 20-fold lower in vitro EC 50 for malaria compared with SARS-CoV-2. 13 Unlike with malaria, where dosing is recommended to start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area, prevention for COVID-19 requires more rapid attainment of therapeutic concentrations, thus supporting the rationale for a loading dose in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. Although, in general, hydroxychloroquine is a well-tolerated drug, increasing the dose may come with untoward effects that should be Table 1 Percentage of simulated subjects with troughs above targeted EC 50 and median cumulative time above targeted EC 50 (0.72 μM), by the end of each prophylactic durations, for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis a Pre-exposure prophylaxis, 12-week simulation duration',\n",

Hydroxychloroquine systemic severe adverse effects include retinal-toxicity and cardiotoxicity, however, these toxicities are mostly associated with daily and/or long-term use. We chose to simulate total plasma concentrations, as the in vitro generated EC 50 was not protein-adjusted yet, it was performed in the presence of protein. 3 Previous studies have shown that in vitro protein binding can occur in the presence of added protein but may not be equal to plasma protein-binding that may be observed clinically in humans. 14 Therefore, we also evaluated our regimens against 1.44 μM EC 50 , which would assume no in vitro protein binding (i.e., most extreme scenario) and found that higher dosing would likely be required in the pre-exposure setting, whereas the post-exposure regimen performed reasonably, although target concentrations were not maintained as long. If higher EC 50 targets are required, dosing may exceed the therapeutic index, although this is largely unknown for hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19. Notably, for many infections (e.g., malaria, influenza, and pneumocystis pneumonia), dosing for prophylaxis are substantially lower than those used for treatment but yet are highly effective.',\n",

This modest success is consistent with our model simulations. In contrast, a study performed in China tested 5 days of 400 mg/day and observed no difference between treatment and control groups, with 13 of 15 vs. 14 of 15 achieving viral negative swabs by day 7. 9 Our simulations have shown that 5 days of 400 mg without a loading dose was not sufficient to maintain daily troughs above the EC 50 in 50% of the subjects for 14 days.

       " 'Significant precipitating factors include fever, bradycardia, sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and cocaine. 6,7 A postulated mechanism of precipitation of BrS with fever is exacerbation of mutant loss of function sodium channels in high temperatures. 8 Adler et al. found that a Type I Brugada pattern ECG was found in 2% of 402 patients with fevers evaluated in an emergency room setting, compared to 0.1% of afebrile controls. 9 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of transient unmasking of BrS with associated PMVT in a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2. The patient likely had incomplete penetrance of a Brugada genotype, and a high fever alone was not able to elicit the characteristic Brugada ECG pattern, as evidenced by the initial normal ECG taken when the temperature was 39.9 o C. However, the combination of high fevers and bradycardia was able to elicit Brugada ECG changes and PMVT. With resolution of bradycardia after CPR, defibrillation and epinephrine administration, the Brugada ECG changes completely resolved. The most likely cause of bradycardia was the use of dexmedetomidine, a centrally acting alpha-2 agonist commonly used in intubated patients as a sedative and analgesic, but observed to induce bradycardia in up to 42% of patients. 10 The bradycardia may be due to a combination of baroreflex-mediated reduction in heart rate, centrally mediated reduced sympathetic tone, and increased vagal tone. 11 Propofol may have contributed, as it has been associated with malignant arrhythmias in BrS. 12 Conflictingly, more recent studies have demonstrated safe use of propofol in patients with BrS. 13 It is unlikely that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed. Neither drug has been described to exacerbate BrS and QTc was normal on all ECGs. However, interestingly, an in vitro study found that acute exposure to azithromycin resulted in transient reduction in peak SCN5A currents. 14 Acidosis and myocarditis can also unmask Brugada, but do not seem to play a major role in this case. The initial ECG was normal despite severe acidosis with pH 7.09, and normalized after PMVT arrest, at which time pH was still 7.13. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide were normal on presentation, making acute myocarditis unlikely. The troponin did elevate immediately after the initial PEA arrest and had serial decline over the next day, likely reflecting transient myocardial injury, but is uncertain whether this contributed to the unmasking of Brugada syndrome. Preexisting structural heart disease cannot be excluded and autopsy was not performed.',\n",
       " 'Although BrS is relatively rare, health care providers should be aware that BrS can be unmasked in COVID-19 patients by high fevers and medications that are commonly used in emergency and critical care settings. A baseline ECG should be obtained for all patients. If telemetry is available, V1 should be monitored for Brugada ECG changes and leads II or V5 for QTc prolongation for patients on hydroxychloroquine. If Brugada ECG changes are seen, treatment of fever and bradycardia should be a priority, as well as avoidance of medications that could provoke BrS. 2) A baseline ECG should be obtained for all COVID19 patients.',\n",

As a result, the clinical outcome from previous CQ or HCQ trials were, in fact, the collective manifestation of both R and Senantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity liabilities. Our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of CQ and HCQ against live SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. S-chloroquine (S-CQ) and Shydroxychloroquine (S-HCQ) were found to be 27% and 60% more active against SARS-CoV-2, as compared to R-CQ and R-HCQ, respectively. With these data and previous work on stereoselective metabolism of CQ and HCQ, we recommend that future clinical studies should employ S-HCQ as a potentially superior drug substance for the treatment of COVID-19 for improved therapeutic index.',\n",
       " 'Treatments are desperately needed to lower the hospitalization and case fatality rates of SARS CoV-2 infection. In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.',\n",

       " 'Chloroquine has been shown to be capable of inhibiting the in vitro replication of several coronaviruses. Recent publications support the hypothesis that chloroquine can improve the clinical outcome of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. The multiple molecular mechanisms by which chloroquine can achieve such results remain to be further explored. Since SARS-CoV-2 was found a few days ago to utilise the same cell surface receptor ACE2 (expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine) as SARS-CoV-1 [85 , 86] ( Table 1 ) , it may be hypothesised that chloroquine also interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells. Wang and Cheng reported that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV upregulate the expression of ACE2 in lung tissue, a process that could accelerate their replication and spread [85] . Although the binding of SARS-CoV to sialic acids has not been reported so far (it is expected that Betacoronavirus adaptation to humans involves progressive loss of hemagglutinin-esterase lectin activity), if SARS-CoV-2 like other coronaviruses targets sialic acids on some cell subtypes, this interaction will be affected by chloroquine treatment [87 , 88] . Today, preliminary data indicate that chloroquine interferes with SARS-CoV-2 attempts to acidify the lysosomes and presumably inhibits cathepsins, which require a low pH for optimal cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [89] , a prerequisite to the formation of the autophagosome [49] . Obviously, it can be hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk with its target cell can be altered by chloroquine through inhibition of kinases such as MAPK. Chloroquine could also interfere with proteolytic processing of the M protein and alter virion assembly and budding ( Fig. 1 ) The S glycoprotein determines the host tropism. There is indication that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on pneumocytes [85 , 99] . Binding to ACE2 is expected to trigger conformational changes in the S glycoprotein allowing cleavage by the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 of the S protein and the release of S fragments into the cellular supernatant that inhibit virus neutralisation by antibodies [100] . The virus is then transported into the cell through the early and late endosomes where the host protease cathepsin L further cleaves the S protein at low pH, leading to fusion of the viral envelope and phospholipidic membrane of the endosomes resulting in release of the viral genome into the cell cytoplasm. Replication then starts and the positive-strand viral genomic RNA is transcribed into a negative RNA strand that is used as a template for the synthesis of viral mRNA. Synthesis of the negative RNA strand peaks earlier and falls faster than synthesis of the positive strand. Infected cells contain between 10 and 100 times more positive strands than negative strands. The ribosome machinery of the infected cells is diverted in favour of the virus, which then synthesises its non-structural proteins (NSPs) that assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex to favour viral subgenomic mRNA synthesis (see the review by Fehr and Perlman for details [101] ). Following replication, the envelope proteins are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and then move to the Golgi compartment. Viral genomic RNA is packaged into the nucleocapsid and then envelope proteins are incorporated during the budding step to form mature virions. The M protein, which localises to the trans-Golgi network, plays an essential role during viral assembly by interacting with the other proteins of the virus. Following assembly, the newly formed viral particles are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are released by exocytosis. It is possible that chloroquine interferes with ACE2 receptor glycosylation, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells. Chloroquine could also possibly limit the biosynthesis of sialic acids that may be required for cell surface binding of SARS-CoV-2. If binding of some viral particles is achieved, chloroquine may modulate the acidification of endosomes thereby inhibiting formation of the autophagosome. Through reduction of cellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, chloroquine may also inhibit virus replication. Moreover, chloroquine could alter M protein maturation and interfere with virion assembly and budding.

[11] [12] [13] [14] However, all 4 documents emphasize the importance of discontinuing all QT-prolonging drugs at the onset of chloroquine treatment rather than when excessive QT prolongation is first recognized (as done in our case). Furthermore, all 4 documents emphasize the need for repeated QTassessment at shorter time intervals (rather than after 5 days, as done here). Our patient developed an arrhythmic storm of recurrent TdP 6 hours after discontinuation of chloroquine despite potassium supplementation, probably reflecting the relatively long half-life of chloroquine. 15 A huge number of patients are being treated with chloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive QT prolongation, defined as prolongation to a QTc >500 msec, has already been reported for 11%-25% of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin. 7 Many of these patients are elderly and have comorbidities that increase the risk of drug-induced LQTS.

Most of the studies included in our analysis reported use of multiple drugs like antibiotics, antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir combination, arbidol, oseltamivir, favipiravir, remdesvir, hydroxychloroquine), and steroids.

Chai et al. analyzed the expression of ACE-2 receptors in liver tissue and found that their expression on cholangiocytes (59.7%) was much stronger than on hepatocytes (2.6%) [16] . It has also been observed that ACE-2 expression increases in hepatocytes, in cases of liver injury [4, 17] .

Here, we show that 24 hours of in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) with HCQ significantly impacted transcription of 16 genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. Using transcriptome data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE and A549 cells and PBMC derived from confirmed COVID-19 infected patients, we determined that only 0.24% of the COVID-19 PBMC differentially expressed gene set and 0.39% of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cells differentially expressed gene set overlapped with HCQ-related differentially expressed genes. Moreover, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly impacted transcription of 159 genes in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages involved in cholesterol biosynthetic process and chemokine activity. Notably, when we compared the macrophage HCQ-related gene lists with genes transcriptionally altered during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19+ patients, the CXCL6 gene was impacted in all three transcriptional signatures revealing evidence in favor of chemokine modulation. HCQrelated transcriptional changes minimally overlapped with host genes altered in postmortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 participants. These results may provide insight into the immunomodulation mechanisms of HCQ treatment in the setting of COVID-19 and suggest HCQ is not a panacea to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

       " \"SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus capable of rapid transmission and causing severe clinical symptoms; much of which has unknown biological etiology. It has prompted researchers to rapidly mobilize their efforts towards identifying and developing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Discovering and understanding the virus' pathways of infection, host-protein interactions, and cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. While it is known that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including inhibiting autophagy, there are also dose-limiting toxicities in patients that make clearly establishing their potential mechanisms-of-action problematic. Therefore, we evaluated a range of other autophagy modulators to identify an alternative autophagy-based drug repurposing opportunity. In this work, we found that 6 of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells with EC 50 values ranging from 2.0 to 13 µM and selectivity indices ranging from 1.5 to >10-fold. Immunofluorescence staining for LC3B and LysoTracker dye staining assays in several cell lines indicated their potency and efficacy for inhibiting autophagy correlated with the measurements in the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. Our data suggest that autophagy pathways could be targeted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and become an important component of drug combination therapies to improve the treatment outcomes for COVID-19.\",\n",

       " \"Introduction Hydroxychloroquine was recently promoted in patients infected with COVID-19 infection. A recent experimental study has suggested an increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in mice. Objective The present study was undertaken to investigate the reality of this putative drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin using pharmacovigilance data. Methods Using VigiBase ® , the WHO pharmacovigilance database, we performed a disproportionality analysis (case/noncase study). Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. Results Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as 'fatal outcomes'. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9-139.3). In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6-13.8). Conclusion Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by completed suicides) than one of the two drugs when given alone.\",\n",
       " \"The present study was performed to search for a possible drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine + metformin related to the recently developed off-label use of hydroxychloroquine in the field of COVID-19. In addition, some studies have investigated hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in diabetic patients to achieve a better control of type-2 diabetes conditions [10] . Conversely, metformin was studied as an adjunctive therapy for systemic lupus erythematous, a condition for which hydroxychloroquine is routinely administered [11] . In fact, our study was prompted by the paper from Rajeshkumar's group [5] showing a higher mortality ratio (30-40%) in mice treated with hydroxychloroquine + metformin in comparison with the control group receiving metformin alone. The authors found an increased number of autophagosomes in the heart, liver and kidneys of mice treated with the combination. They did not conclude about a univocal mechanism for their observation but suggested a synergistic effect between metformin, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I, and hydroxychloroquine, which inhibits autophagy [5] .\",\n",
       " 'Our study did not allow for discussion of the possible mechanism of action but shows a safety signal with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. We found that more reports of fatal outcomes (and especially suicides) are registered in VigiBase ® with the association than with each of the drugs administered individually. No conclusion can be made for chloroquine due to the absence of lethal reports with the association.',\n",
       " \"Of course, our work suffers from the classical biases of all pharmacovigilance studies: under-or selective reporting and lack of systematic information on doses and duration of exposure in VigiBase ® . Of course, it is important to underline that ROR investigates the risk of ADR reporting rather than a true risk. Our study was not performed in COVID-19 patients but in those receiving hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic or dermatologic diseases. However, there is no reason to believe that the described drug-drug interaction could depend on the underlying disease(s). It was not possible to perform direct adjustments due to the characteristics of VigiBase ® . However, Seabroke's group found that in large pharmacovigilance databases, subgroup analyses (as performed in this study) improve both sensitivity and precision and are clearly beneficial over crude analyses [12, 13] .\",\n",
       " 'The fact that the completed suicide/non-suicidal ratio is higher for the association than with the drugs alone could suggest an additional toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and metformin taken together. Since hydroxychloroquine doses are higher for COVID-19 than for lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, this might increase the significance of the signal.',\n",

They are reflective of clinical conditions and cases were retrieved from the world's largest pharmacovigilance database. It used a validated method for the first detection of pharmacovigilance signals [7] [8] [9] . We found high significant values of ROR suggesting a true association between the investigated factors. Our results extend the conclusions obtained in animals by Rajeshkumar et al. [5] and should be considered as a meaningful pharmacovigilance signal of a drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin. In fact, metformin is a widely used drug, particularly in aged and/or obese patients that are found to be particularly at risk for COVID-19 pandemic infection [14] .\",\n",

The Hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, but further, more extended studies, with a higher number of patients, are needed to confirm these results. Besides its limitations, repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy: they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market; there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution; and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy. Most of the studies found in this article are scheduled to end in 2020, and we hope these repositioning trials may help to find solutions for COVID-19 treatment by this year.',\n",

While increased sputum secretion could cause airway obstruction during mechanical ventilation, there are few reported cases in the literature. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diabetes and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nafamostat, and prone positioning. Initially, mechanical ventilation consisted of a heat moisture exchanger, endotracheal tube aspiration, and subglottic secretion drainage using a closed suction system. However, endotracheal tube impaction by highly viscous sputum occurred during this mechanical ventilation system. Replacing the endotracheal tube, the use of a humidifier instead of a heat moisture exchanger, and prone positioning contributed to the patient being weaned off mechanical ventilation. Although anti-aerosol measures are important for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, attention should be given to potential endotracheal tube impaction during mechanical ventilation.',\n",

Ciclesonide was also discontinued, as we did not expect that enough of the drug would reach the alveolar epithelium while the patient was under mechanical ventilation. In this hospital, we decided to use hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and nafamostat, as it is expected that hydroxychloroquine provides an antiviral effect and suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines [13] . Combined hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatments have proven effective and safe in a small-scale non-randomized study [14] , and it is anticipated that nafamostat controls the early stages of a COVID-19 infection and suppresses the IL-6 amplification circuit [8] .

Though patients with risk factors such as age, gender and comorbidities have an increased rate of complications and mortality, there is still a high proportion of seemingly young and healthy infected patients with no identified risk factors who suffer from severe side effects and complications, while some infected patients never go on to develop anything more than anosmia. 18 It is common for respiratory viral infections to predispose patients to bacterial superinfections, leading to increased disease severity and mortality; for example, during the influenza pandemic in 1918, where the primary cause of death was not from the virus itself but from bacterial superinfections. The same was apparent in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where again bacterial superinfections were the primary cause of death as opposed to the virus itself. 19 Despite the proven importance of superinfections in the severity of respiratory disease, they are often understudied during respiratory infection outbreaks, mainly due to the fact that diagnosing a superinfection is complex. 19 Other strands of the coronavirus have shown to enhance streptococcal adherence to epithelial cells along the respiratory tract, causing complications such as pneumonia 20 and inflammatory damage in the lungs that inhibit the clearance of bacteria. Zheng et al. 21 compared the levels of granulocytes in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 infections to those suffering from severe infections. Patients suffering from severe infections had a remarkably higher neutrophil count and a significantly lower lymphocyte count than in mild patients. A high neutrophil count is abnormal for a viral infection, but very common for a bacterial infection, resulting When lymphocyte levels reduce, severity increases. This was also seen by Liu et al., 22 who deduced that the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio predicts the severity of the patient's response to COVID-19. They found that in severe cases, over 80% of patients had an exceptionally high bacterial load secondary to a bacterial superinfection and required antibiotics. This is supported by the promising research performed in France, 23 where a combination of hydroxychloroquine (antiviral) and azithromycin (antibiotic) was shown to cure 100% of patients virologically after six days, compared to patients who had hydroxychloroquine alone (57.1%) and those who had no treatment (12.5%). While the use of hydroxychloroquine has been under much dispute, it is important to understand that antibiotics clearly play an influential role in treatment outcome, improving the success rate by 42.9% in this case. A retrospective report of 1,060 patients in May 2020 confirms the efficacy of using a combination of an antibiotic with an antiviral, with 91.7% virologically cured after ten days. 24 Furthermore, Chen 26 illustrating the potential importance of antibiotics and therefore bacteria in the course of a COVID-19 complication. 19 See Figure 1 for the outcomes of different treatment options for COVID-19. The lungs, similar to the oral cavity, are often referred to as an 'ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic organisms' . 27 Microbial immigration and elimination are constant between the oral cavity and the lungs, allowing for a healthy microbiotic distribution. 28 Similar to the gut or the oral cavity, bacterial communities that colonise the lungs are recognised for their function in conserving tissue, immune and organ homeostasis. The lungs are unique, however, as they are oxygen-rich and therefore contain a fine equilibrium of lipidrich surfactants that influence bacteriostatic activity. This equilibrium can alter drastically during illness, allowing microbial overgrowth and injury to the lungs. Lower respiratory infection is initiated by the contamination of the lower airway epithelium by inhalation of microorganisms encompassed in aerosolised droplets, or by aspiration of oral secretions associated with oral disease (containing microorganisms such as P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia). 29 Periodontitis and decay are the two most common oral diseases associated with an imbalance of pathological bacteria in the mouth. Cytokines (such as IL-1 and TNF) from periodontally diseased tissues can infiltrate the saliva through the gingival crevicular fluid and be aspirated to cause inflammation or infection within the lungs (Fig. 2) . 30 Therefore, inadequate oral hygiene can increase the risk of inter-bacterial exchanges between the lungs and the mouth, increasing the risk of respiratory infections and potentially post-viral bacterial complications. 31 In a nationwide population-based cohort study, 49,400 chronic periodontitis patients were treated with periodontal therapy over 11 years. The Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated the total incidences of pneumonia significantly decreased over a 12-year follow-up in the group receiving periodontal therapy (p <0.001). The reduction or eradication of periodontal disease significantly reduces one's risk of pneumonia.\",\n",

G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease . We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country. Methods: We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey. We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region. Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement. The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour. Findings: Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers. The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min). Conclusion: Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries. To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.',\n",
       " \"Moreover, chloroquine has recently been shown to be a useful drug for the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [10] . which has so far infected over 1,200,000 million people with more than 62,000 deaths [41] . Based on this, some countries are considering the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 cases, despite the safety concerns raised regarding its use due to the possibility of chloroquine causing hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [9] . Considering this, checking the G6PD deficiency status of a COVID-19 patient prior to treatment with chloroquine may be ideal, particularly in malaria-endemic countries such as Ghana. Hence, it would be prudent to improve the availability of and accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency prior to the recommendation of the use of chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients in malaria-endemic countries such as Ghana. Using GIS to inform the implementation of health services has been shown to be useful [42] [43] [44] . GIS effectively enables the implementation of POC testing in health networks to streamline decision making at the POC [45] . Geospatial science has also been proven to be useful in creating solutions for population access to POC testing during emergencies, outbreaks, and disasters such as the present COVID-19 pandemic [46] . Hence, GIS helps improve patient outcomes, time and money, ensure that the health networks are sufficiently resourced to deliver needed health services to the population [45] . Despite these strengths, there are several limitations worth noting such as our inability to include non-spatial factors in the analysis. Non-spatial factors such as the income of a patient [47] , age, cultural practices, education, and others can also influence the utilization of a health service even if the service is very close to the individual [48] . Although this study is recommending implementation of POC testing for G6PD deficiency at rural PHC clinics, it did not assess the cost-benefit analysis of its implementation. However, knowing the G6PD status of a patient is useful clinical information and the cost of implementing POC for G6PD deficiency testing service at rural PHC clinics by the Government of Ghana should not be a reason to deny a special sub-population such as pregnant women and newborns access to G6PD deficiency testing because Ghana is a malaria-endemic country. It is also possible some private hospitals and medical laboratories within the region may be providing G6PD deficiency screening test and where not included in this study's analysis. The travel time estimation provided by this study was dependent on only one mode of public transport using an assumed speed which might be inaccurate. Moreover, this study was only limited to only one region in Ghana and therefore the findings may not necessarily apply to the remaining fifteen regions in the country. We, therefore, recommend future researches to focus on areas such as the non-spatial factors, cost-benefit analysis of implementing POC testing for G6PD deficiency at PHC clinics not captured by this study. We also recommend a similar study in the other fifteen regions of Ghana. We further recommend future studies to included other modes of transportation such as walking, car, motorbike, bicycle, and others where applicable in the analysis. Nonetheless, this study has provided evidence-based information useful for policy decision making for targeted improvement of POC testing for G6PD deficiency in the UER. This study also provides baseline information for future studies since it is the first study to evaluate the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana and perhaps, worldwide.\",\n",
       " 'G6PD deficiency POC test permits clinical diagnostic decisions either to administer anti-malarial drugs/SP or not in resource-limited settings and useful for improving health outcomes and the cost of accessing G6PD testing services. Spatial analysis estimated current mean distance and travel to a G6PD deficiency testing center from all locations in UER to be over 33 km and 60 min respectively using a motorized tricycle. This could be reduced significantly with the implementation of POC testing for G6PD deficiency at PHC clinics located more than 10 km away from a health facility. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.

Notably, amiodarone toxicity is mainly cumulative and dose-dependent, which means that the risk of AEs is directly related to the duration of the treatment [10] .

       " 'SARS-CoV-2 can gain entry into the host cell through binding of the S-protein to the membrane-bound ACE2 aminopeptidase, which then is cleaved by serine proteases to allow for membrane fusion and invasion. 14,28 Following infection, there is a reduction in pulmonary ACE2, either through internalization with viral entry and/or downregulation of ACE2 enzyme during this process. Hence this may exacerbate the lower baseline ACE2 function in hypertensive patients to lead to the accumulation of AII and reduced angiotensin 1-7 and subsequently worse immune-related cytolysis and lung injury, which was validated by the linear association between elevated plasma AII level and viral load or lung injury in COVID-19 patients. 29 The use of ACEI or ARB likely promotes feedback upregulation of ACE2 expression in hypertension, although there are animal and human studies which have also found either no effect or downregulation of ACE2 level in the setting of diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease, with or without ACE/ARB therapy. 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] Nonetheless, this may explain our finding that ACEI/ARB therapy can be protective in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further evidence that would support this come from earlier studies in which ACEI/statins were protective in severe pneumonia, recombinant ACE2 protected mice from lung injury following SARS-CoV infection, and RAAS blockade reduced acute lung injury in rats injected with SARS-CoV S-protein. 34, 35 Currently, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 except for supportive care.

The anti-viral activity and immunomodulating effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are potentially valuable in dampening pro-inflammatory cytokines, given evidence of cytokine storm in fatal cases [10, 25, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combination resulted in 100% clearance of viral load in respiratory secretions of 36 patients, and reports from China suggest chloroquine may result in pneumonia inhibition and truncated disease courses [32, 33] . However, a recent observational study found no association between hydroxychloroquine and rates of intubation or mortality [34] . Continued research delineating the effects of these medications remains necessary in the COVID-19 pandemic. A preliminary, non-peer-reviewed analysis at the New York University found a high prevalence of QTc > 500 ms at 11% in a sample of 84 patients, with renal failure being a strong risk factor, although they did not demonstrate an association with mortality [35] . A few other observational studies of small sample sizes have also established an association with QT prolongation and these medications [36] [37] [38] . No studies, however, have been performed in vulnerable minority populations. Refining treatment strategies in these populations remains a priority given reports of worse outcomes [8, 9] .

Additionally, the proportion of men and women that met the criteria of QTc prolongation using the cutoffs of ≥ 470 ms and ≥ 480 ms increased significantly relative to baseline (14.3% vs 34.3%, p < 0.001), even when controlling for electrolyte abnormalities. The proportion of patients on antiarrhythmics known to prolong the QT interval, class I, and III medications, was low (4.8%) thus conferring minimal impact on our results. The overall incidences of RBBB, LBBB, and non-specific intraventricular conduction block were also low and not significantly different between pre-and post-medication ECGs, making these arrhythmias unlikely contributors to the impact on QTc prolongation. Given this data, it is reasonable to conclude that the administration of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and/or azithromycin likely confer a risk for QTc prolongation. However, there were no cases of TdP or ventricular fibrillation, and only one patient with ventricular tachycardia. Additionally, all fatal COVID-19 cases in this sample were due to respiratory complications. Thus, while there may be a statistically significant increased risk of developing prolonged QTc in patients treated with these medications, the clinical risk of harm or death may be outweighed by the potential benefit of treating the infection for the vast majority of patients. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating efficacy data for hydroxychloroquine. Additional studies are necessary to determine the exact risk-benefit ratio for such therapy.',\n",

Moreover, patients monitored with serial 12-lead ECG recording were more likely to be in an ICU or specialized unit where more resources for serial testing were available. This is supported by the high intubation rate in our cohort and may contribute to the observed mortality rate. Additionally, intubation and mortality rates likely reflect the selection of the sicker COVID-19 infected population. Despite this, treatment with hydroxychloroquine did not appear to cause harmful proarrhythmic events. Additional prospective controlled studies will be necessary to truly determine the risk-benefit ratio of such therapy. Arrhythmia monitoring should be more routinely implemented and incorporated into institutional protocols for more patients receiving these medications as is suggested by other guidelines [22, 23] . Enacting such policies will allow further, larger studies to support the conclusions made by this study.',\n",

Based on these findings, patients with QTc prolongation at baseline may be at increased risk for arrhythmias and should be monitored more closely. Risk-benefit analyses should be carefully considered for each patient. RCTs are necessary to further inform the use of these medications in COVID-19 patients.',\n",

       " 'Sir, The use of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 is controversial following the report of a case series of COVID-19 patients with inflammatory diseases [i.e. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis] treated with hydroxychloroquine. 1 We report the case of a man in his seventies (95 kg, 1.83 m, BMI 28.4 kg/m 2 ) admitted to the Emergency Department of a hospital for fever, dyspnoea and polypnoea. Upon arrival, he was conscious, oriented and without cardiac disorders. He presented with fever (38 C), with 98% oxygen saturation and resting respiratory rate at 26 cycles/min, blood pressure at 150/83 mmHg and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) at 77 mg/L. The patient reported the onset, 9 days earlier, of a cough (without sputum), with feverish sensation, myalgia, rhinitis and confusional syndrome with memory loss. His GP ordered a cough suppressant. His medical history included sarcoidosis affecting the lungs, skin and heart requiring the installation of a pacemaker and prescription of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg q12h and prednisone 7 mg q24h for 1 year. Since that day, the multivisceral sarcoidosis was controlled by this dual therapy. Given the clinical picture in the Emergency Department, empirical antibiotic and antiviral therapy [ceftriaxone (1 g q24h), spiramycin (1 MIU q8h) and oseltamivir (75 mg q12h)] was prescribed with 2-3 L/min oxygen (via mask). The chest CT scan showed small areas of ground-glass opacities, i.e. typical lesions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a nasopharyngeal sample returned positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (Ct = 16.53). In light of the latter results, he was then referred to the Infectious Diseases Department, where antibiotics and oseltamivir were discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine was maintained for his sarcoidosis.',\n",

The use of this agent for treatment of COVID-19 has been described in case reports 17, 18 and in a case series of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore. 19 We found 18 clinical trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, whose mechanism of action is similar. 20 The in vitro antiviral activity of chloroquine has been known for a long time 21 and was described on a number of viruses including SARS-CoV. 22 However, chloroquine failed to demonstrate a benefit in the treatment of viral diseases such as influenza, dengue or chikungunya. [23] [24] [25] Regarding COVID-19, a recent publication reported an activity of chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 26 and another encouraged the use of chloroquine for patients with COVID-19 on the basis of unreported clinical results. 27 Experts in China have suggested the use of chloroquine for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 but no clinical data has been provided yet to support this announcement. 28, 29 Remdesivir is evaluated in 5 clinical trials but with the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial. Studies in vitro in human airway epithelial cell assays demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits replication of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV. 30 In mouse infection models, remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 30, 31 In a recent non-human primate study, remdesivir treatment initiated 12 hours post inoculation with MERS-CoV provided clinical benefit with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. 32, 33 The rationale of using stem cell therapy is based on its immunomodulatory properties that could be interesting in severe COVID-19. 34, 35 However, stem cell-based therapies have not demonstrated an effect in treating other viral diseases and the scientific background to test them is weak. The fact that stem cell therapy, that has not shown any effect in antiviral diseases, was one of the most frequently assessed therapies is unexpected. This highlights the fact that researchers should strive to conduct clinical trials with the most promising candidates, according to in vitro and preclinical in vivo scientific data.',\n",
       " \"It is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors abundant in the respiratory tract and lungs to infect cells [8] [9] [10] . CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds ACE2 cellular receptors to facilitate fusion and ultimately entry into cells. Chloroquine (CLQ) is being investigated as a prophylactic or therapeutic and is reported to inhibit the activity of CoV-2, thus launching the investigation into possible binding sites to ACE2 [11] . Molecular docking studies were employed to investigate different flavonoid molecules' potential binding efficacy to ACE2 metallopeptidase domain. We are however aware that there are other possible binding sites of these molecules, including the CARS-CoV-2RBD domain of ACE2 [12] . Figure 1 highlights flavonoids investigated by us including hesperetin [7] , myricetin [13] , Linebacker, and caflanone (FBL-03G) [14] . Binding energy results are highlighted in Figure 2 in comparison to that of CLQ, which is currently in clinical trials as a potential prophylactic and treatment of COVID-19. These preliminary works indicate that flavonoids could bind with high affinity to the spike protein, helicase, and protease sites on the ACE2 receptor causing conformational change to inhibit viral entry of coronaviruses. For comparison, the results indicate that the investigated flavonoids could bind equally or more effectively than CLQ. The binding results highlight potential for considering these flavonoids as prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2. A close look at the interaction of CLQ seen in Figure 3A ,B indicates two possible binding poses in different regions of the metallopeptidase domain. Although CLQ seen in Figure 3A exhibits a lower affinity for the site, it is making a key pie-cation interaction with His374 that in turn coordinates with zinc (ZN). The second predicted pose of CLQ inverts the structure allowing for binding deeper into the catalytic site and farther away from zinc. As a result, the chloroquinoline group of CLQ makes pie stacking interactions with the residue of Thr371 and a salt bridge interaction with Glu406 ( Figure 3B ). The structurally diverse caflanone also interacts within the catalytic site of ACE2 ( Figure 3C ) and makes multiple favorable interactions with Glu375, Glu402 that coordinates with ZN, Phe274, and Arg273. Moreover, in vitro study results (Table 1) for caflanone show potential to inhibit virus entry factors including, ABL-2, [15] cathepsin L, [16] cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, Mip-1α, TNF-α), [17] , and PI4Kiiiβ [18] , as well as AXL-2, which facilitates mother-to-fetus transmission of coronavirus [19] . Mip-1α 8.9\",\n",
       " 'In perspective, previous studies on CLQ have shown that chloroquine can block endocytosis of nanoparticles [28] . The docking study results above suggest that smart nanoparticles with flavonoids might be more effective in binding the ACE2 receptor and could represent a significant improvement or advance in targeting such indications. Smart nanoparticles can also be constructed along the lines of the multi-compartment liposome [29] , which have hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments to carry flavonoids or other drugs for more effective targeting to enhance their effectiveness. In general, advantages of using such smart technology includes better disease targeting, ability to cross membranes and enter cells, longer duration drug action, lower doses, and reduced side effects, which is of vital importance.',\n",
       " 'There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13 th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1-and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'Notably, neither chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited a sustained plasma concentration above their reported SARS-CoV-2 EC90 across their reported dosing interval.',\n",
       " 'Ultimately, the implications of this for therapy will depend upon whether systemic suppression is a prerequisite for a reduction in morbidity or mortality, but this does raise some concern for ongoing trials with these drugs (chloroquine: NCT04323527; NCT04333628 hydroxychloroquine: NCT04316377; NCT04333225; NCT04307693 and lopinavir/ritonavir: NCT04331834; NCT04255017; NCT04315948 ). However, the predicted lung accumulation rather than plasma exposure may provide some therapy advantage and/or give more reassurance for ongoing chemoprevention trials.',\n",

       " 'During inflammation or injury, changes to the vascular microenvironment, could have a profound effect on the ability of these drugs to accumulate in lung cells. Due to the recruitment of neutrophils and leaky endothelial cells [73] , the lung inflammatory microenvironment is characterized by increased body temperature, excessive enzymic activity and most importantly, by a low interstitial pH [74] . In the case of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, these diprotic weak bases are exquisitely dependent on a pH gradient to drive lysosomal uptake as a mechanism of lung accumulation. It has been demonstrated that cellular chloroquine uptake is diminished one hundred-fold for every pH unit of external acidification [75] . This situation is likely to deteriorate further on mechanical ventilation, which also induces acidification of the lung tissue, independently of inflammation [76, 77] . Therefore, the benefits of lung accumulation for many of these drugs may be lost during treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, mefloquine is monoprotic and more lipophilic than chloroquine, which may make it much less reliant on the pH gradient to drive cellular accumulation in lung. It is likely that the charged form of the drug is sufficiently lipophilic to allow movement across biological membranes along a concentration gradient [78] . Only two studies have described mefloquine uptake into cells, one study suggested that mefloquine uptake is not energy-dependent and the other suggested that mefloquine uptake is mediated by secondary active transport, rather than passive proton trapping [79, 80] . Mefloquine is known to cause severe psychiatric side effects in some patients and so use of this drug should be managed with care [81] . Therefore, mefloquine may offer opportunities for treatment during severe disease that are not available with other drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 therapy. If the high lung exposures are proven empirically for the drugs on this list, then some may also prove to be valuable for chemoprevention strategies.',\n",

There were a couple of limitations in the study. First, due to the unexpected onset of this epidemic and the availability of active drugs only, we were not able to conduct a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, which would have been more objective and largely excluded the possible impact of open-label use on a given physician's assessment. Second, because the Chinese government implemented a robust intervention approach that effectively controlled the epidemic, the study was terminated before full enrollment (n=40 each for the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine groups, n=20 for the control group). Thus, while we demonstrated positive results, the study per se was underpowered. We used a one-month study period and a sample size of 30 (n=18 for (hydroxy)chloroquine vs. n=12 for control) to conduct a post-hoc power analysis. With the alpha level (single-sided) set at 0.025, we would only expect 13.7% (chloroquine vs. control) or 9.2% (hydroxychloroquine vs. control) power, respectively, for detection of a real difference in the median numbers of TTCR days (5.5 days, 6.0 days, and 7.5 days) for chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and control treatment, respectively.\",\n",

Second, we used Kaplan-Meier TTCR curves/Logrank testing, which is not a point estimation of efficacy but, rather, a rigorous statistical assessment.

The results of this trial will be instrumental in determining if hydroxychloroquine may play an important role in mitigating the global impact of COVID-19.',\n",

This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand.',\n",

The mechanism of action on viruses for these two medicines is probably the same effect. Chloroquine has been used for a long time to treat malaria and showed positive outcomes on patients. Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine showed a significant effectiveness to kill intracellar pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever (22) . The French open label non-randomized clinical trial was promising and the first clinical trial of these medication on COVID-19 patients. The effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significant because it showed reduction in the viral load when it compared with the control group (22) . Moreover, the effect of Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective when azithromycin was added to the patients according to their clinical needs. However, clinical follow-up and occurrence of adverse effects were not discussed in the paper; further work should be done on these medicines to reduce the spread of .

The drugs studied include Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir and α-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO). Our results indicate that these small drug molecules selectively bind to stable, kinetically active residues and residues adjoining them on the surface of proteins and inside protein pockets, and that some prefer hydrophobic over other active sites. Our approach is not restricted to viruses and can facilitate rational drug design, as well as improve our understanding of molecular interactions, in general.',\n",
       " 'Covid-19 is the first severe global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, and there are no guarantees that it will be the last. We therefore need not only to develop an effective and efficient treatment for the current pandemic, but also have to design a set of protocols to address all future, similar pandemics. In this manuscript we presented our strategy to recognize potential drug binding residues in human and viral proteins. We analyzed four currently approved drugs (Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir, and Eflornithine). Our results indicate that small, drug like compounds preferentially bind to kinetically active and adjoining residues, thus seeking stable residues characterized by fast normal modes with small amplitude of fluctuations [28] . Some drugs preferentially seek active patches that are hydrophobic (Chloroquine, Ivermectin), while others prefer hydrophilic surfaces (Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Eflornithine). We can postulate that in water environment drugs binding to hydrophilic patches will be more stable, as their removal will lead toward the reduction in structural entropy, but a full account of this proposition will require calculations of binding free energy differences based on full atom molecular dynamics, using, for instance, steered molecular dynamics simulations (SMD) [31] . We can also propose that the drugs/small molecules that bind to deep pockets will be more stable, and thus more effective. Our algorithm accurately recognizes such pockets as binding spots for drugs (Figure 3 ), and small peptides (see, in particular, Figure 6a in [28] ).',\n",

Considering the significantly increased use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic, this case alerts us to the potential for HCQ to be associated with hepatotoxicity and the need to monitor liver function during HCQ therapy.',\n",

The use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, which was based on in vitro studies, has had mixed results. 2 22 Studies from one group suggested a benefit on the surrogate outcome of viral clearance among hospitalised patients, but these studies either had inadequate or no comparator groups. 23 24 Two randomised controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine had conflicting findings. 25 26 A phase IIb randomised controlled trial comparing two doses of chloroquine among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 with historical controls from Wuhan detected a negative safety signal-QTc prolongation-but no clinical benefit. 27 Finally, two observational studies using propensity score matching to account for confounding by indication have found no significant benefit with either hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin on clinical outcomes including mortality 28 29 ; however, Epidemiology these studies were limited by design issues and a high risk of bias due to unmeasured confounding.',\n",

       " \"Les éléments que nous avons présentés dans cette revue de la littérature incitent à prendre davantage en considération l'évolution des patients souffrant d'anxiété avec une focalisation respiratoire préexistante et à s'enquérir d'une telle évolution chez les autres. Les patients souffrant d'un trouble panique pouvant se voir qualifié de « respiratoire » doivent faire l'objet d'un suivi thérapeutique adapté. Le recours aux psychotropes à visée anxiolytique, principalement les benzodiazépines, mais également les antiasthmatiques de type salbutamol (Ventoline®) peuvent se montrer contreproductifs voire dangereux sur l'évolution de la pathologie anxieuse, mais également au regard de la pandémie au SARS-CoV-2. Sur ce second aspect, le risque d'hypokaliémie doit être anticipé en ayant la connaissance des multiples facteurs de risques qui peuvent y concourir chez les patients atteints de trouble panique et souffrant d'un asthme avéré ou supposé -mais traité comme tel -: (i) le recours au salbutamol à hautes doses, (ii) l'infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de symptômes digestifs (diarrhées et vomissements). Ce risque doit être mis en relation avec le fait que l'hypokaliémie augmente le risque d'allongement de l'intervalle QTc et que les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques, et notamment de trouble panique, peuvent recevoir des traitements sources d'augmentation de l'intervalle QT (i) avec les psychotropes : comme le citalopram et l'escitalopram, ainsi que l'hydroxyzine, ou encore les phénothiazines (chlorpromazine, cyamémazine, lévomépromazine, propériciazine), (ii) mais également avec les traitements potentiels de la COVID-19, comme les combinaisons à base d'(hydroxy)chloroquine ± azithromycine ou l'association lopinavir/ritonavir [11] . La confrontation à la dyspnée, naturellement anxiogène et sans doute plus encore dans un contexte pandémique, vécue au décours de la COVID-19, pourrait induire une augmentation de la prévalence du trouble panique et particulièrement à type respiratoire. L'anticipation d'une augmentation des cas avec une agoraphobie co-morbide, par une conséquence délétère du confinement prolongé pouvant renforcer un comportement d'évitement dysfonctionnel sur le long terme lié à la crainte de contracter la maladie ou de subir une hypothétique ré-infestation, peut sembler également légitime. La compréhension du processus impliqué dans l'apogée des sensations corporelles à l'origine du ressenti d'une menace intéroceptive, convertissant l'anxiété en panique, apparaît fondamentale pour bien anticiper les conséquences psychiques de vécus dyspnéiques traumatiques [53] . Cette prise en considération semble d'autant plus importante que sur l'exemple de l'asthme, notamment sévère, des expériences traumatisantes associées à une sensation de mort imminente, peuvent certainement influencer le développement de cognitions effrayantes et la genèse de troubles anxieux sévères, comme le trouble panique [54] . Cette éventualité est également à resituer au regard de la publication de Katon de 2010 évoquant deux études permettant de relier l'asthme à l'augmentation du risque suicidaire [54] .\",\n",

Preliminary data have shown that remdesivir effectively inhibited virus infection in a human liver cancer cell line . Chloroquine is a potential broadspectrum antiviral drug and it already has been widely used as a low-cost and safe anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug for more than 70 years. Application of chloroquine causes elevation of endosomal pH and also interferes with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ACE2. This probably has a negative influence on virus-receptor binding and abrogates the infection (Vincent et al., 2005) . Drug repurposing seems like a very good strategy for quickly and at low cost finding a new therapy for new human diseases (Oprea and Mestres, 2012) . To date, there are few substances with Gquadruplex stabilizing features. One example is topotecan (also known by its brand name Hycamtin ® ), which frequently is used for treating ovary cancer. If everything else fails, it seems to be an option. On the other hand, topotecan cause unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Topotecan -Chemotherapy Drugs -Chemocare).

We report the case of a 60-year-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication. This case highlights a significant and potentially life-threatening complication of HCQ use.',\n",

Our patient developed RBBB and critically prolonged QTc (QTc > 500 ms) after 3 days of HCQ at a cumulative dose of 1,400 mg. A systematic review of chronic use of chloroquine and HCQ in rheumatic conditions reported cardiac side effects to be common. Among patients who were treated with HCQ who experienced cardiac toxicity (n = 50, median duration of use 8 years [range 10 days to 30 years], and cumulative dose of 1,235 g [range 1.9 g-4,380 g]), the study reported bundle branch block (26%), atrioventricular block (24%), and firstor second-degree heart block (4%). 6 Other cardiac adverse effects of HCQ included ventricular hypertrophy (32%), ventricular hypokinesia (16%), heart failure (ejection fraction < 40% in 52.9%), and valvular dysfunction (8%), especially with high cumulative doses. 6 Other adverse effects of HCQ include gastrointestinal, ophthalmic, neurological, musculoskeletal, psychiatric, metabolic, and dermatological abnormalities. 7 Patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization are at risk for complications including electrolyte derangements, which are risk factors for QTc prolongation. 8 Our patient had several risk factors for conduction abnormalities: administration of HCQ, lopinavir/ritonavir, and inotropes, and hypocalcemia. Lopinavir/ritonavir is also associated with the prolongation of QTc, but the ECG after starting this medication was normal. Among the electrolytes associated with the prolongation of QTc, only calcium was slightly low. Inotropes were started 2 days (noradrenaline) and one (dopamine) day before the detection of conduction abnormalities. Unfortunately, we did not obtain an ECG on the third day of HCQ therapy. We considered the possibility of myocarditis. The elevated troponin coincided with the period leading up to conduction abnormalities and peaked several days later, before decreasing. A repeat TTE was normal. We did not perform further investigations for myocarditis, as our patient remained stable. It is possible the other factors discussed contributed to the development of conduction abnormalities, but the resolution of ECGs changes after discontinuation of HCQ suggested a causal relationship between HCQ and these abnormalities.',\n",

       " 'Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now been confirmed worldwide. Yet, COVID-19 is strangely and tragically selective. Morbidity and mortality due to COVID19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Human genetic factors may contribute to the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to the relentlessly progressive disease observed in a small but significant proportion of infected individuals, but these factors are largely unknown. Main body: In this study, we investigated genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 by examining DNA polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (two key host factors of SARS-CoV-2) from~81,000 human genomes. We found unique genetic susceptibility across different populations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Specifically, ACE2 polymorphisms were found to be associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions by altering the angiotensinogen-ACE2 interactions, such as p.Arg514Gly in the African/African-American population. Unique but prevalent polymorphisms (including p.Val160Met (rs12329760), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)) in TMPRSS2, offer potential explanations for differential genetic susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as for risk factors, including those with cancer and the highrisk group of male patients. We further discussed that polymorphisms in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 could guide effective treatments (i.e., hydroxychloroquine and camostat) for COVID-19. Conclusion: This study suggested that ACE2 or TMPRSS2 DNA polymorphisms were likely associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19, which calls for a human genetics initiative for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

Relationship among spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 were shown as a triangle, with each pair connecting by physical binding (double-headed arrow) or cleavage (single-headed arrow). We propose three hypotheses for COVID-19 therapeutic options: (i) for patients with wild-type or naïve expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine, or E-64D) combined with camostat may offer more clinical benefit; (ii) for patients with polymorphisms or dysregulation on TMPRSS2, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine monotherapy may offer more clinical benefit; and (iii) for patients with polymorphisms or dysregulation on ACE2, the patients who might have mild symptoms can recover in a short period. All three pharmacogenomics models for COVID-19 must be validated both experimentally and clinically before being used in patients urgently needed to be tested in COVID-19 patients in the near future. As the high-resolution protein structure of TMPRSS2 is not yet available, further functional observations and clinical validation are warranted for all abovementioned genetic and pharmacogenomics findings. We anticipate that large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are urgently needed to identify likely causal host genetic risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes using genetic data from patients with COVID-19; such knowledge will improve risk stratification of individuals exposed to or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and allow for precision medicine interventions for COVID-19. A COVID-19 host genetics initiative is already underway to bring together the human genetics research community to generate, share, and analyze data in a search for the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes [27] . The first COVID-19 GWAS identified the 3p21.31 gene cluster (including SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, and XCR1) as a genetic susceptibility locus in severe patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure [28] . Yet, our study aims to look for SNPs associated with disease severity of COVID-19, but not disease susceptibility. In summary, systematic identification of the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and clinical outcome, including both virus and host factors (e.g., ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms), could guide personalized treatment in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic and even explain current epidemiologic observations (i.e., males, elderly at high risk, and clinical comorbidities) and natural history.',\n",

Political leaders have touted their use and recommended availability to the public. These anti-inflammatory agents have substantial human toxicity with a narrow therapeutic window. CQ and HCQ poisoning cause myocardial depression and profound hypotension due to vasodilation. Bradycardia and ventricular escape rhythms arise from impaired myocardial automaticity and conductivity due to sodium and potassium channel blockade. With cardiotoxicity, ECGs may show widened QRS, atrioventricular heart block and QT interval prolongation. CQ may also cause seizures, often refractory to standard treatment. Of concern is pediatric poisoning, where 1-2 pills of CQ or HCQ can cause serious and potentially fatal toxicity in a toddler. The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ. Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required. Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease. Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.',\n",
       " 'The pandemic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterised by progressively severe pneumonia and ARDS that leads to a high mortality rate among hospitalised patients, challenges the medical community to evaluate rapidly any possibly effective antiviral drug [21] . On the basis of in vitro studies of different coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), it seems that a number of drugs may be candidate treatment options, including LPV/r, chloroquine, HCQ and remdesivir [14] [15] [16] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

       " \"Concerning infection-related issues, the first and more predictable reason is the occurrence of cardiac arrest due to respiratory failure ............................................................................................................................................................................................................ 13, 14 There are at least two elements supporting this theory. The former is the presence of suspected symptoms or of a defined diagnosis of COVID-19 before the event in 125 patients, representing 74% of the increase in OHCAs in 2020. The latter is that hypoxia is one of the causes known to be associated to non-shockable presenting rhythm, 15 being one of the 'five Hs and Ts'. This, along with the 3-min increase in EMS arrival time, 16 could explain the increase in non-shockable rhythm. However, questions arise as to why these patients developed respiratory failure at home. The rapid progression toward ARDS has been reported in single case reports describing a rapid worsening to respiratory failure, even in patients who were apparently stable a few hours earlier. 17, 18 This could have been fatal to some patients, not leaving them sufficient time to activate the emergency system. This phenomenon is truly alarming, especially considering that the age of the patients who suffered an OHCA during the epidemic is not particularly high and is similar to that in 2019. Moreover, in some cases, the severity of the clinical situation and the risk of its rapid progression could have been undervalued, with resulting at-home care attempts favoured by the impossibility of mass COVID-19 kills at home hospitalization, despite extraordinary efforts of the local and national government to immediately increase ICU beds and the capacity of general wards. 19 Risk factors associated with the progression to ARDS have been identified in some populations, 18,20 but they were retrieved from critically ill patients with already confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and they may not be appropriate for discriminating patients at risk among those treated at home. However, respiratory failure cannot be the only explanation for the increase in OHCAs. It cannot be excluded that some patients experienced arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) related to this infection. A non-negligible percentage of patients affected by COVID-19 in fact experienced myocardial injury, [21] [22] [23] and a series of mechanisms possibly leading to SCD have been proposed, 24 including the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which were proposed as a treatment for COVID-19, 25 on QT interval prolongation, 26 with the consequent risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, the infection itself could have played a role in prolonging the QTc values, as the elevated level of some cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), can suppress IKr in heterologous cells and myocytes, resulting in prolonged repolarization, and IL-6 also markedly blunted the hERG/IKr channel mRNA and protein expression. 27 Recent evidence highlighting that the QTc values might be at the upper limits or even prolonged in many patients with COVID-19, even before starting drugs potentially causing QTc prolongation, also seems to confirm this mechanism. 28 Notably, in four out of six patients of our population with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 and a post-ROSC ECG available, a prolonged QTc was found. However, we found that also in nonsuspected or diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the percentage of those with a prolonged QTc was similar, possibly caused by myocardial ischaemia. Indeed, it has been known for >40 years that a prolongation of the QT interval is associated with a major increase in the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD either after a myocardial infarction 29 or in the general population. 30, 31 In addition, digestive symptoms (i.e. diarrhoea and vomiting) are present in a fair number of COVID-19 patients, especially in those with mild disease severity, with a delayed diagnosis and treated at home, 32 and they were also experienced by 7% of the suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 patients in our cohort. All these conditions may favour hypokalaemia, which can drive powerful electrophysiological effects on the myocardial cells, promoting life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. 33 Moreover, recent data suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) could be a complication in COVID-19 patients, 34 and this could have been another cause of OHCA in our population, consistent with a non-shockable presenting rhythm.\",\n",

There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19.

Direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with COVID-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles, making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier.

Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is >5 years. It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage. We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate.

Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity. Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.',\n",

An early course of corticosteroid, specifically methylprednisolone, at the onset of dyspnea, may attenuate progression to the hyper-inflammation phase that requires escalation of care in patients with COVID-19. In this study, 3 days of early corticosteroids were administered at a median 2 days into hospitalization and eight days from symptom onset. However, the administration of a 3 day course of corticosteroids later in the disease course (median 5 days after hospitalization), as occurred in our SOC group, did not appear to confer the same benefit.

The effects of hydroxychloroquine are not equivocal. In another setting that is the treatment of chikungunya infection, in spite of an inhibitory effect of chloroquine on the chikungunya virus in vitro, chloroquine's immunomodulatory effects were associated with delayed immune responses, higher levels of viral replication, and worse illness [15, 16] . While hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir are largely available and cheap, the potential benefit of their administration in critically ill patients has not been evaluated so far and caution is needed before considering their broad use [17] . In our retrospective analysis conducted in the ICU, whether our patients did or did not receive a specific treatment (i.e., with either antiviral or immunomodulatory activity), a similar proportion of them needed treatment escalation (within the 24 h after the admission in the ICU). Furthermore, there was a similar viral load reduction between groups. In addition, there was a similar proportion of patients with negative respiratory tract viral shedding on day 7 according to treatment allocation. In line with this, our results cannot confirm or refute the conclusion of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines which suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir and stated that there is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in critically ill adults with COVID-19-related pneumonia [18] . As compared to international guidelines [18] , doses of hydroxychloroquine used in our patients were lower (200 mg twice a day versus a loading dose of 400 mg twice a day followed by 200 mg three times a day) which could explain the lack of beneficial effects of our strategy. Since no clear recommendations were available at the beginning of the outbreak, we conformed to our local disease control policies.

These studies tested RT-PCR at different points in time; Chen et al. reported no difference in viral clearance rates on the 7 th day of treatment (18) . Tang et al., in their RCT, found no difference in the primary endpoint of the rate of RT-PCR negativity at 28 days with hydroxychloroquine treatment (17) . RT-PCR negativity was also comparable at days 4,7,10, and 14 days in this study. In the Mallat et al. study, RT-PCR negativity was significantly lower with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group (10). Our meta-analysis also revealed no effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral clearance by RT-PCR testing with the administration of hydroxychloroquine. The in .

       " 'The present work involves study of interaction between hydroxychloroquine, a known antimalarial and a putative anti-SARS-COV-2 drug, and the protease of the latter. Molecular docking study reveals that HCQ docked at the binding site due to high electrostatic interactions, H-bonds etc. MD simulation study shows there is a robust change in the main protease of SARS-COV-2. RMSD data shows that there is a remarkable structural change in the protease moiety at 2 ns, around the time the drug begins closer interaction with the protease. The drug-protease system attains equilibrium at around 7 ns. The RMSD plot also shows that the main protease backbone gets destabilized following interaction with the drug molecule. It is interesting that the number of H-bonds between the drug and protease increases as drug-protease complex forms, while the average H-bonding distance shows the opposite trend. The present molecular docking and MD simulation studies suggest that the drug hydroxychloroquine may have considerable effect on structure protease of SARS-COV-2, which may lead to significant inhibitory effect on the latter.

A total number of 49 patents and 2178 potential drug candidates have been listed in the CAS Registry of Chemical Substances for M pro . CoV-infected patients administered with the HIV drug combination of lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra), a M pro inhibitor, have shown considerable improvement (NCT04307693 46 and NCT04255017 47 ), highlighting M pro as a high-value target for the development of drug candidates against CoVs. 3, 48 Another clinical trial study on ACS Combinatorial Science pubs.acs.org/acscombsci Review different combinations of protease inhibitors such as oseltamivir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 49 is presently underway for treatment of COVID-19. 50 Twenty-seven clinical trial studies registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine database were underway on the protease inhibitors in CoV infections as of May 6, 2020. 51 A number of reports have been published on the design of small-molecule and peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the substrate binding pocket of SARS-CoV M pro . 12, 13 However, no such inhibitor has advanced to clinical trials to date. An alternative approach includes the combinatorial design of peptide-based inhibitors that target the dimerization of SARS-CoV M pro as a potential therapeutic strategy. Dimerization inhibitors have been successfully employed against HIV protease and other viral enzymes. 52−57 The various mutation analyses listed in the present review highlight the key residues of SARS-CoV M pro that are crucial for the dimerization and thus catalytic activity of the enzyme. The studies provide future directions for the design of potential dimerization inhibitors against M pro . The MD studies of M pro compiled in the review will act as molecular guide for the structure-based design of potent dimerization inhibitors. In addition, the already reported dimerization inhibitors of M pro will provide the framework for further modifications to design potent antiviral agents. The peptide-based interface inhibitors may provide better therapeutic options than small molecules, as the large surface area of the dimer interface of M pro will be better targeted with peptide inhibitors. The peptide-based inhibitors have additional advantages over small molecules as drug candidates due to their greater chemical diversity, high specificity, low toxicity, possibility of rational design, low accumulation in tissues, and stability toward proteolytic cleavage (peptidomimetics). 54,56,58−60 In parallel with the drug development, scientists around the globe are actively involved in developing rapid point-of-care diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       " 'A novel coronavirus disease , caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.',\n",

Both trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled studies. One trial involved 308 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, and the other involved 453 severe COVID-19 patients. Under the registration number NCT04257656, 453 severe COVID-19 patients were scheduled for admission. With the outbreak under control in China, 237 cases (remdesivir group; 158 and placebo group; 79) were enrolled in the trial, and the study results showed no significant clinical benefit among adult patients admitted for severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. 23 Also, antimalarial drugs potentially treat COVID-19. 24 The results by Gautret et al showed that hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with virus elimination in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin. 25 A limitation of the present study is that the results of the clinical trials were not included. As viral spread is currently being controlled, the number of patients will greatly decrease in China; thus, meeting the needs of all patients registered in clinical trials may be difficult. As the current pandemic worsens, the more we will have to adhere to the evidencebased medicine, for the recovery of the patients, and the effective prevention, and control of the pandemic. At this time, it is necessary for the national and local administrative departments to strengthen the management. The relevant departments should organize research in a scientific, standardized and orderly manner, and call on the relevant departments to conduct on-site inspection, supervision and research. In future research, we will analyze the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 clinical trials in China and other countries.

It has placed societal and financial burden on the globe. Its rapid progressions from mild URI symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a matter of days is the underlying reason as to why the world is struggling to keep up with ventilator production. In this case report, we went about proning a corona virus positive patient for 6-8hrs as a potential early intervention to prevent progression to ARDS. Our patient was initially in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and placed on nasal cannula. He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms. However within the span of few hours of proning he experienced significant symptomatic relief with improvement of oxygenation. His oxygen saturation improved drastically and eventually was taken off of nasal cannula and discharged within span of one day of proning.',\n",
       " \"Prone positioning causes improved oxygenation by alteration in the mechanics and physiology of gas change. Improvement in gas exchange by prone positioning occurs by enhancement of ventral-dorsal trans-pulmonary difference, reduced dorsal lung compression and better lung perfusion. Prone positioning causes the intra-pleural pressure to become less negative in nondependent and less positive in dependent portion of lung due to thoracic-lung shape modification which in turn causes reduced dorsal lung compression by increase of regional inflation distribution in dorsal region and decrease in ventral regions. [1, 2] . In acute lung injury, since blood flow and alveolar collapse are both greatest in the dependent portion of lungs, there is a significant ventilation perfusion mismatch in supine position, however in prone position the previously dependent lung continues to receive the majority of the blood flow (independent of the gravitational gradient) as alveoli reopen, while the newly dependent lung continues to receive the minority of the blood flow as alveoli begin to collapse. [3] Of note, although in health lungs pulmonary perfusion is greatest along dependent portion of lungs, studies have shown that in the diseased lungs, blood is diverted towards non-dependent positions through various mechanisms including hypoxic vasoconstriction, vessel obliteration and external vessel compression. [4] Our patient had severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV2) induced pneumonia as evidenced by characteristic laboratory and imaging findings. Significant improvement in patient's oxygen saturation was noted after the patient was prone for at least 6-8 hours. Several studies have shown that in most patients with ARDS (up to 70 percent), prone ventilation increases PaO 2 allowing a reduction in the FiO2. Mure, M et al reported a study showing the positive effect of prone positioning on oxygenation in patients with acute lung insufficiency. 12 of 13 patient responded to treatment in prone positioning showing dramatic increases in oxygenation index and decrease in A-a gradient. [5] . Although our patient did not meet the criteria for ARDS, his oxygen saturation improved clinically status post lying in prone position. This could've possibly been secondary to effects of hydroxychloroquine as well however it was stopped prior to proning without significant improvement in oxygenation. C. Valter et al reported a case showing improvement of PaO2 in non-intubated hypoxemic respiratory failure with prone positioning.

We undertook a meticulous process in identifying duplicate reporting: (i) case reports from China were excluded, (ii) when a hospital had published their cases more than once, only the paper with the biggest data or published on the later date was included, (iii) we were able to identify the duplicates from our own publication, 11 which is the biggest cohort series with available pregnancy outcome data from China and (iv) when necessary we contacted the corresponding authors using their native language, i.e. Chinese and Spanish, thus increasing the chance of receiving a response from them. We did not apply any language restrictions in order to capture a global picture of the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes and most importantly we had the capability to ensure that data from China could be accurately interpreted and recorded. There were several major limitations. We were unable to include the second biggest cohort series with available pregnancy outcome data from China because the data were pooled from a national registry. 35 Despite contacting the corresponding author directly, it was not possible to identify the actual sources of cases.

       " 'Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.',\n",

The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of Chloroquine and its potent derivative Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. At the same time screening was performed for some chemically synthesized derivatives of Chloroquine and compared their binding efficacy with chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives through in silico approaches. For the purpose of the study, some essential viral proteins and enzymes were selected that are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiplication as putative drug targets. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and some of their chemically synthesized derivatives, taken from earlier published studies were selected as drug molecules. We have conducted molecular docking and related studies between Chloroquine and its derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and the findings show that both Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can bind to specific structural and non-structural proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different efficiencies. Our current study also shows that some of the chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives can also potentially inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins by binding to them and concomitantly effectively disrupting the active site of these proteins. These findings bring into light another possible mechanism of action of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and also pave the way for further drug repurposing and remodeling.\",\n",

With the molecular docking studies, the hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions formed as a result of binding of the drugs to the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were identified (Table 5 .1 supplementary).

       " 'The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. Importantly, among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on ACE2 maturation. Thus, our results suggest that these drugs could act against SARS-CoV-2 by altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2.',\n",
       " 'Multiple pieces of evidence indicate that down-regulating the expression of ACE2 in the early stages of the SARS-CoV2 infection should effectively inhibit virus replication. However, selectively decreasing the expression of a target protein could be a difficult task. RNA silencing or CRISPR-based strategies represent valid options, but their use could be limited by delivery issues [26, 27] . These problems could be overcome by emerging pharmacological technologies like the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which build on the principle of designing bi-functional compounds capable of interacting with the target protein with one side and engaging the E3 ubiquitin ligase with the other, leading to the degradation of the polypeptide by the proteasome [28] . Similarly, the PPI-FIT method capitalizes on the cellular quality control machinery to promote the degradation of the target polypeptide, although it does not require the development of bi-functional molecules. PPI-FIT-derived compounds aim at stimulating the removal of the target protein by directly blocking its folding pathway [18] . In this manuscript, we described the first step along with the application of the PPI-FIT paradigm to ACE2 by reporting the all-atom reconstruction of the folding pathway of the protein. Our analyses predict the existence of a folding intermediate showing two unique druggable pockets not present in the native ACE2 conformation. In order to respond to the urgent need for an effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2, we targeted both pockets by a in silico virtual screening approach aimed at repurposing compounds currently in clinical trials or already approved by the FDA. Interestingly, among the predicted ligands for pocket 2 we found the quinoline-derivative mefloquine. This drug belongs to a class of antimalaria agents recently described for their potential effect against SARS-CoV-2 [29, 30] . While the precise mechanism by which chloroquine and its more active derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit virus replication is not known, reports suggest that the compounds may act by reducing the glycosylation of ACE2 [31] . This evidence is highly consistent with a PPI-FIT-like effect of these drugs, which could alter the correct maturation of ACE2 glycosidic moieties by acting on the folding pathway of the protein. Based on our previous experience with the PPI-FIT technology, we anticipate that the possible down-regulating effects of our in silico predicted compounds targeting the ACE2 folding intermediate will be easily tested in cell-based assays by mean of standard biochemical techniques like western blotting.',\n",

Hydroxychloroquine has recently been shown to increase the risk for cardiotoxicity without discernable anti-viral benefit, and it remains unknown whether tocilizumab is effective against COVID-19 [1] . Other coronaviruses (CoVs) have been demonstrated to invade the CNS, infect neurons, and cause an influx of inflammatory cytokines and immune cells in the CNS.

In the case of MERS, this was associated with abnormal brain MRI findings of widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions within the white matter and subcortical areas, and with negative CSF PCR for the MERS-CoV virus. The evidence for neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-1 is stronger: SARS-CoV-1 has been reported to invade the CNS in mice transgenic for human ACE2 and was detected in human brain autopsy specimens.

None of them were receiving biologic treatment, six were on colchicine treatment, five were symptomatic. Four patients were treated and followed-up via outpatient clinic and/or phone, one was hospitalized for 5 days, two were asymptomatic and followed-up without treatment.

Our planet is suffering from SARS CoV-2 since the first couple of days in 2020. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this novel coronavirus outbreak as pandemic on 11st of March 2020, and the first confirmed case in Turkey was reported on the same day. We have encountered this little-known foe relatively later compared to many other countries. Until that time, many treatment and prevention strategies have been already developed by the health care providers of other countries. Therefore, we were able to make stringent isolation decisions like prompt lockdown and establish our national treatment guidelines which contains hydroxychloroquine and other current available options. Hence, even it is early to mention, numbers of confirmed cases and deaths seem to be low in our country.',\n",
       " 'As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic takes an ever-increasing toll, the urgent search for effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions is rapidly accelerating. This includes lopinavir/ritonavir (7, 8) , chloroquine (9), remdesivir (10), as well as IFN-α/β (2) and ARB (4) and combinations of these. Most of these antivirals only have in vitro data to support consideration for coronavirus targets prior to clinical testing; as such, while unfortunate, it is not surprising that there is a high chance of failure (11) . However, we had shown during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Canada that IFN-α treatment could hasten resolution of coronavirus-mediated human disease (3). This prompted us to evaluate IFN-α therapy for COVID-19 disease in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Indeed, our analysis suggests that inhaled IFN-α2b accelerated viral clearance from the respiratory tract and hastened resolution of systemic inflammatory processes when compared to ARB treatment alone. Notably, a recent publication reported that ARB treatment, at the same doses used in this study, did not affect the rate of viral clearance in non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with untreated patients (12) . While we recognize that our data are at best suggestive, given the urgency, the findings indicate that a follow-up randomized clinical trial (RCT) is now warranted. Success may not only benefit the individual infected patient but, by reducing duration of viral shedding even in moderate cases (such as this cohort), assist in slowing the population spread.',\n",

They might also have used high doses of HCQ as antiviral agents rather than for antiinflammation. In contrast, the dose of HCQ used in the present study is much lower than that in previous studies but is the same as used for treating inflammatory diseases, and thus HCQ for COVID-19 patients works more likely as an agent for anti-inflammation and immunomodulation, rather than as a direct antiviral agent. Recently, Geleris et al. (2020) reported their observation study, showing that there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death. By carefully re-analyzing this report, however, we noticed that in this study, HCQ-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline (even if after propensity score-matched) than NHCQ-treated patients. In addition, the time of treatment for patients is too short (5 days) to show the efficacy of HCQ.

With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to 29 infect millions of people. To date, close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease, 30 COVID-19. The high need for treatment options, together with the lack of small animal models 31 of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo 32 evidence attesting their efficacy was available. We used Syrian hamsters to establish a model 33 to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting. 34 Upon intranasal infection, the animals developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and 35 pathology similar to that observed in mild COVID-19 patients. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-36 infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) 37 resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus. Micro-CT scan 38 analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals, which was 39 confirmed by histopathology. In addition, both compounds did not prevent virus transmission 40 through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments. By modelling the PK profile 41 of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations, we show that the total lung 42 exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor. In conclusion, we here characterized a hamster 43 infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral 44 compounds.

There is an urgency of developing a therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of COVID-19. Towards that initiative, potential drugs like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin have been tested by diverse group of researchers worldwide for their potential against novel coronavirus. The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMPα/β1) mediated viral import.',\n",

First, strategies directed against the virus have led to the use of repurposed drugs (such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, LPV/r and ribavirin) and novel investigational compounds (such as favipiravir and remdesivir). We do not yet know which, if any, of these compounds will eventually be proven effective against SARS-COV-2. Thus, the collaboration of the healthcare community to engage patients for participation in clinical trials is essential. In addition to the single-center and multi-center trials, the World Health Organization recently embarked on a large mega-trial that will compare the clinical outcome of patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, LPV/r and remdesivir. Second, there are numerous clinical trials that are aimed to determine if curbing the proinflammatory state produced during COVID-19 with drugs such as IL-6 inhibitors (e.g., sarilumab or tocilizumab) or anti-GM-CSF compounds (e.g., lenzilumab and gimsilumab) will lead to better clinical outcomes by preventing or reversing ARDS and multi-organ failure.',\n",

[8] [9] [10] In a similar fashion to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, chloroquine also can lead to QT prolongation. 11, 12 Our patient's QTc increased from 458 ms to 520 ms (D62 ms) while receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.\",\n",

As of March 24, 2020, there were 81 COVID-19-positive inpatients receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on non-telemetry floors. We are currently in the process of expanding the use of inpatient monitoring with MCOTs to all of these patients and to similar patients at 4 other hospitals in our health system. The MCOT monitor, which uses the Bazett formula to derive the QTc, received Food and Drug Administration approval for use in patients that require measurement, analysis, and reporting of the QT interval in 2017. In addition to QT monitoring, as this case demonstrates, the use of an MCOT Patch monitor results in a near real-time notification when an arrhythmia occurs. In our experience, there was a delay of 3 minutes between when the patient's ventricular rate went above the notification threshold to the point when the clinical team was alerted. Although a span of 3 minutes may be an exceedingly long time for patients that develop ventricular arrhythmias, the ability to serially monitor the QTc intervals of these patients may facilitate a clinical intervention prior to those arrhythmias occurring. Most important, given the bed shortage, monitoring with an MCOT is a significant improvement when compared to no monitoring at all. Furthermore, given that the patch can be \",\n",

Beside the drug efficacy in patients, the issue concerning the safety is also important. Evidently, if the side effects were to be such marked that they put the life of treated patients in danger, then, as long as beneficial effects have been confirmed, the drug use could be restricted to only very severe cases, when there is no other choice than to try everything that can potentially save the patients. Such use can only be done with close monitoring of the patient.

       " 'The side effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on the heart are mainly of two types: those involving changes in electrical conduction, heart rate and rhythm [14, 24, 27, 31, 80, 120, 121] , and those involving structural changes associated with cardiomyopathy [47, 48] or myocardial remodeling. Conduction and rhythm disturbances can be seen under acute conditions before any structural change, but they can also be favored by the cardiomyopathy [48] . On a time frame, the rhythm changes are acute and reversible upon drug withdrawal, whereas cardiomyopathy is induced after treatment for months and is largely irreversible. All effects are also dose-dependent, and cardiomyopathy [111] and 23 interference with remodeling can be experimentally induced over shorter periods (weeks) with high doses.',\n",
       " 'The mechanisms underlying the conduction and rhythm changes mainly involve inhibitory actions on various ion channels. Block of Na + channels (local anesthetic action) is likely responsible for observed bundle branch and intraventricular block [24, 27, 48] . Block of K + channels will tend to lengthen the action potential duration, whereas the inhibition of Na + and Ca 2+ channels with have opposite effects. That the drugs given alone at low or moderate concentrations and for a short duration produce only limited prolongation of the QT interval is likely due to this balanced contribution of opposite effects [30] . Heart rate changes also result from a balance between a bradycardic action of I f and I Ca-L inhibition [61, 64] and a tachycardic effect of I K1 and I K-ACh inhibition [61, 74, 75] , in addition to the suppression of the vagal tone on the heart [85, 86] . The resultant action of chloroquine can be pro-or antiarrhythmic, depending on the underlying condition [4, 14, 33, 34, 36, 72, 80] .',\n",
       " 'The mechanism underlying chloroquine cardiomyopathy involves an inhibition of autophagy [40, 95, 122] . Even in the absence of cardiomyopathic changes, such an inhibition can aggravate cell damage under ischemia-reperfusion, which by itself causes a change in the autophagic flux and recruits additional cell death mechanisms [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] 97] . The trend to favor myocardial death may be opposed by protective mechanisms due to an inhibition of intracellular Na + and Ca 2+ load and of arrhythmias resulting from the effects on ion channels or due to inhibition of apoptosis [123] .',\n",
       " 'It should be underlined that all cardiac effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could not be covered in this brief review. For example, metabolic effects due to phospholipase A 2 inhibition have been proposed to mediate an anti-ischemic action of chloroquine [124] . In addition, other effects may not yet be known, and the consequences of autophagy inhibition on the expression of various proteins could be more complex. Finally the effect of the drugs and their mechanisms may depend on coexisting non cardiac (e.g. electrolyte) changes or cardiac diseases (e.g. the presence of myocarditis). The side effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are generally mild, but they can be exacerbated by drug associations. Many macrolide antibiotics can cause a QT prolongation when used in isolation 24 [120] . If co-administered with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, the effects on the QT interval might add and become marked, even if the effect of every drug taken separately was mild. Use of high doses and association with other potential QT-prolonging drugs are likely the cause of the marked QT prolongation and occurrence of arrhythmias that have recently led to interrupt clinical trials testing the benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 [16] . Even when apparently moderate mean doses are reported to have been used in large registries of patient groups, there will be large variations among different patient groups and a significant number of them might have been exposed to high drug doses. In any case, drug associations and the role of complicating conditions such as hypokalemia that are themselves drug dose-dependent, should also be analyzed before concluding on the direct cardiotoxic effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.',\n",
       " 'The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been proposed for antiviral therapy, including for COVID-19. The drugs are relatively safe when used at low or moderate doses, with blood concentrations ≤ 1 µM. At such doses they can display beneficial, e.g. antiarrhythmic, actions, and despite the many effects on K + channels, they do not seem to be associated with prominent QT prolongation Acute life-threatening cardiac effects, including ventricular tachyarrhythmias, are obtained with high doses. Given the long half-life of the drug, other side effects are usually associated with long-term treatments. The mechanisms underlying chloroquine effects include direct actions on ion channels and receptors, while others (especially a cardiomyopathy developing following long-term treatment) involve the inhibition of autophagy. Care should therefore be taken to limit the dose and the duration of treatment with the drugs, as well as to avoid association with other drugs with known toxic effects on the myocardium. 25 Declarations Funding: Work of the author is supported by funding from VLIR-UOS in the frame of an Institutional University Cooperation between Flemish universities and the Université Catholique de Bukavu.',\n",

Patient reporting could have been influenced by the operator and symptoms could have been missed as these could have appeared after the date of completion. To address this potential bias, we reviewed the electronic health records of all patients to detect possible cases and asked all our patients to actively contact us if any of the compatible symptoms occurred. Secondly, we only included rheumatic patients treated with tDMARDs without a control group, either treated with other type of DMARDs or untreated patients. While including also rheumatic patients without these therapies would have also been useful information, the exceptional workload during the lockdown period compelled us to prioritise the group of patients who were initially considered to be the most vulnerable. Thirdly, our study is mainly focused on chronic inflammatory arthritis and we did not include, for example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or giant cell arteritis that could provide additional insights into the protective effect of hydroxychloroquine and anti-IL6 therapies. Further, the lockdown effect might be more pronounced in IMID patients since they are considered an immunosuppressed cohort protecting them from possible exposure to infection and, therefore, distorting their comparison with general population.',\n",

The effective drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease M pro , because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1), Amodiaquine (2), 2 -Fluoro-2 -deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs.

The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.',\n",

The results of the docking studies aimed at studying the binding mode of these drugs to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The results revealed that amodiaquine (2) and ribavirin (4) showed the best affinity with the target receptor, even though this behavior was not experimentally verified. It was predicted that the amodiaquine showed the lowest binding energy (−7.77 Kcal/mol) with respect to the other drugs. Moreover, amodiaquine binding affinity is lower than that of the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir which have binding affinity −6.06 and −4.96 Kcal/mol; respectively. The results of the molecular docking have been illustrated in terms of the DFT calculations. The DFT results showed that amodiaquine (2) is the most lying HOMO, and consequently it could be the best to act as an electron donor. Moreover, the most electrophilic centers of the drug 2 are N 11 , N 31 , and O 29 and this could be attributed to the presence of the lone pair of electrons on these atoms. Further, the π-π stacking could be another hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the receptors. Additionally, a high basicity (χ = 3.70) and dipole moment (µ = 14.4 Debye) of drug 2 rather than the others, could be the other factors that enhanced the extent of the binding affinity. It could be concluded that these parameters share together with different magnitudes and affect the degree of the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites to afford a certain degree of inhibition. Finally, from these in silico studies for drug 2, it is very promising to perform further in vitro and small animal model in vivo studies to establish a solid experimental evidence of its activity as inhibitors for COVID-19.

By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus.

Recent publication of several observational studies has generated much discussion surrounding efficacy of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, stressing the need for high-quality prospective, randomized control trials in patients with COVID-19. Ongoing 'Stay at Home' orders and institutional policies mandating 'Work from Home' for non-essential employees, which includes most research personnel, have impacted the ability to implement and conduct clinical studies.

Among these two, HCQ is may be more effective than CQ. Though, the early positive clinical outcomes, less possibility of severe adverse effects, might drawn the attention of the prescribers to use these drugs empirically, but latest evidences are not supporting the use of these two drugs either in alone or combination and also with or without macrolide, especially in curing the infection. But, prophylaxis use of hydroxychloroquine in Indian healthcare workers has been producing the beneficial effects with mild adverse effects.',\n",

       " 'This study has several implications. To begin with, since there has been anecdotal evidence that promising drugs for COVID-19 such as Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), Chloroquine (CQ), and hydroxychloroquine (H0) have shown no significant benefits to health outcomes of patients, developing effective and safe medications specific for the treatment of COVID-19 is of utmost importance [59] [60] [61] . Furthermore, the findings show a lack of behavioral psychosocial research on how people react with COVID-19 emergency [32] . Future research should consider the risk factors of psychosocial distress at interpersonal or cultural aspect, impact of mass media and social media on behaviors of population to COVID-19, as well as behavior-change interventions to each research subject. Additionally, we found a lack of research on the social stigma caused by COVID-19. Due to the rapid contagion of the virus, fear and anxiety about being infected can give rise to stigma and discrimination toward people, places, or things. For instance, people associated with the disease, such as being in a neighborhood of high risk or being a civilian of a nation with a high rate of COVID-19 infection, are often stigmatized [62, 63] . Stigma can also arise when people are released from quarantine, even though they have been confirmed to be negative and are no longer risk. Although there have been several published guidelines for reducing social stigma related to COVID-19, further investigations into the detrimental effects of social stigma and development of interventions for this problem should be considered [62, 63] . Finally, due to the rapid spread of this disease, the vulnerable population, such as the elderly living in nursing homes, workers in industrial zones, refugees, migrants, or persons with disabilities are at higher risk of getting an infection, will need extra precautions [64] . However, these high-risk clusters have not received enough concern from the researchers, even on commentary or local government. More research and preventive actions should be done so as to not leave these people behind [64] .',\n",

Several drugs are being investigated as potential treatment for COVID-19, but we note that some early published studies have been poorly controlled. 11, 12 Based on scant scientific data, the Unites States Food and Drug Administration has approved the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. 13 It is imperative that we learn from the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic and ensure that trials of therapeutics are done under conditions which allow for the collection of high-quality, interpretable data to inform future clinical care.',\n",
       " 'While there is no evidence-based protocol for COVID-19 management, so far, we started the management based on our local protocol for a high-risk group. We administered him, initially, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and oseltamivir, since there is a study showing that these combinations might have a role in viral eradication [25] . After a few days of improvement, he developed ARDS, which might be due to a severe COVID-19 cytokine storm, so the infectious disease team administered him tocilizumab, steroid, and other antiviral medications [26] . This rapid improvement supports our diagnosis of cytokine storm. However, we did not confirm the diagnosis by sending the level of interleukins because they are not available in our hospital. Also, the patient findings were not corresponding with a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and bone marrow aspiration was not done as the patient has improved.',\n",

Secondly, by day 10 and day 14 since treatment initiation, higher proportion of patients had undetectable viral RNA in the chloroquine group (91.4% and 95.9% respectively; Table 2 ) comparing to the non-chloroquine group (57.4% and 79.6% respectively; Table 2 ). In the aspect of clinical manifestations, we found that the duration of fevers is shorter in chloroquine versus non-chloroquine among patients experienced fever symptom (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8; P = 0.0029; Supplementary Figure S1 ). To note, the antipyretic effects of chloroquine may have also contributed to this result. We observed no difference in the length of hospital stay (Supplementary Figure S2) . No patient died or admitted to ICU either in the chloroquine group or in the non-chloroquine group. Among patients who had moderate clinical symptoms at baseline, seven patients experienced aggravated symptoms from moderate to severe level, one in the chloroquine group and six in the non-chloroquine group. The proportion of patients having aggravated symptoms is lower in the chloroquine group but not statistically significant (absolute difference in proportions 3.28; 95% CI -6.96 to 1.43).

They were identified with negative viral RNA test from respiratory tract samples but positive viral RNA test from fecal samples within 7 days following hospital discharge. No such observation in the non-chloroquine group. Investigation is underway to examine whether it is due to re-infection or other factors.',\n",

The results mainly showed that chloroquine has benefit effect on the time to undetectable viral RNA (absolute difference in medians -5 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0 days) and the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 is higher in chloroquine group (absolute difference in proportions 32.7; 95% CI 23.9 to 42.1).

       " 'We recognize that our study has several limitations. This study was carried out under the COVID-19 public health emergency. Due to the limited medical capacity and urgent clinical situation, we were unable to conduct a standard randomised controlled study to formally evaluate efficacy and safety of chloroquine versus placebo. As an observational study, we have to note that several factors may influence the interpretation of the result. It is reasonable to suspect that the dramatic improvement in the primary outcome in chloroquine could be due to the later treatment initiation since symptom onset. Firstly, gaining experience in treatment management and attenuation of the virus during the course of the epidemic could contribute to the improved outcomes. Secondly, we cannot rule out the possibility that among those with longer interval time between symptom onset and treatment, some may already have been on the course of recovery. Thirdly, although it is impossible to dissect the influence from other antiviral therapies used before chloroquine, it is a plausible assumption that chloroquine is the first antiviral therapy Review 2020, in press). Chloroquine has a favorable effect on glucose and lipid metabolism 18 . Therefore, chloroquine may exert its antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting endocytosis and autophagy, and stabilizing glucose and lipid metabolism.',\n",
       " 'The adverse reactions of chloroquine drugs are of great concern to the community. Although it is an old anti-malarial drug, its safety in treating COVID-19 patients is still unknown. In the present study, we did not observe serious adverse events in patients with chloroquine. All adverse events observed during the study period are known side-effects for chloroquine ( Table 3) . The main adverse events were symptoms in gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric systems. Chloroquine is known for its side effects in cardiovascular system. In the chloroquine group, we did not find significantly higher rate of adverse events in patients older than 65 or with pre-existing conditions (Supplementary Table 5 Table 6 ). There is no strong evidence that these antiviral treatments were safe and effective in COVID-19 patients 22 In conclusion, our preliminary evidence showed that chloroquine has the potential to shorten the time to SARS-CoV-2 viral suppression and duration of fever in patients with moderate symptoms at earlier stage of the disease, even with reduced dose. Further randomised studies are needed to determine the optimal dose, to assess its benefit for both severe cases and to assess its benefit in settings other than secondary care. Considering that there is no better option at present, chloroquine could be a viable option to combat the coronavirus pandemic under proper management.',\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 pandemic, induced by the novel SARS-CoV-2, represents one of the greatest global public health emergencies since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918 and provides an unprecedented challenge for the identification of both preventive and therapeutic drugs. In particular, vaccines and effective therapeutics to tackle this novel virus are urgently needed. Fortunately, in the last decade vaccine technology has significantly evolved, with the development of several RNA and DNA vaccine candidates, licensed vectored vaccines, recombinant proteins and cell culture-based vaccines for many indications. 91 Moreover, given the similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, the ideal target for the vaccine, the spike S protein on the surface of the virus required for viral entry, has been quickly identified, providing a target antigen to incorporate into advanced vaccine platforms. Thus, antibodies specifically targeting the S protein can block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the host ACE2 receptor, thus neutralizing the virus. However, given the lesson learned from SARS and MERS, the development of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be an uphill road with several obstacles. In fact, several vaccines for SARS-CoV, including recombinant S proteinbased vaccines, have been already developed and tested in animal models, but many did not produce sterilizing immunity in animal models and/or induced severe side effects, such as lung and liver damage. 92, 93 To date, no human CoV vaccines have been approved so far. Moreover, to complicate this scenario, it has to be still unveiled whether infection with CoVs induces long-lived antibody response protecting against the risk of relapsing infections. Thus, scientific community has to overcome several issues for the development of an effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this regard, Ling et al. recently detected SARS-CoV-2specific humoral and cellular immunity in 8 COVID-19 patients, recently become virus-free and consequently discharged. 94 In addition, the neutralizing antibody titers have been significantly correlated with the numbers of nucleocapsid protein-specific T cells. 94 Such evidence indicates that both B and T cells cooperate to protect the host from viral infection. Notably, despite the small sample size, this study laid a theoretical foundation for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, the tracing of past infections, as well as the development of therapeutic antibody drugs and the design of an effective vaccine. Consistently, Long et al. reported acute antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 285 patients with COVID-19. 31 In particular, 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients have been tested positive for antiviral IgG and seroconversion for IgG and IgM have been reported to occur simultaneously or sequentially. 31 Thus, serological testing might be useful to identify suspected patients with negative RT-PCR results as well as asymptomatic infections. 31 However, the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 is spreading has emphasized the urgent need to identify alternative therapeutic strategies in order to contain viral infection and to attenuate the excessive host immune response during the lag of vaccine availability, especially in a scenario where the virus may become endemic and recurrent seasonal epidemics may occur. In this regard, several antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, are currently tested in several clinical trials, either alone or in combination, and compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for SARS-CoV-2. 95, 96 However, antiviral drugs might select for mutational escape, thus rendering this therapeutic approach ineffective. Moreover, still unconfirmed reports indicate sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic agent, 97 with evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases. 98 However, their use needs further evidence and clinical evaluation. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are known to potentially cause heart rhythm problems, that may be exacerbated whether combined with other drugs with similar effects on the heart, and induce adverse liver, kidney and cerebral effects. 99 Thus, as discussed in this review, treatments addressing the immunopathology of the infection, such as immunomodulatory drugs approved for different clinical indications, have become a major focus. Such approaches show the advantage to override viral mutational escape and to exert less-selective pressure on viral population. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggering such process. Hence, future dissection of immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 will provide novel insight on the effects of the virus on human immune system and may reveal relevant biological players that can be targeted to blunt cytokine storm. Notably, since it is well established that innate immune responses trigger the activation of multiple and redundant signaling pathways, an effective therapy may require to acting, at the same time, on multiple signaling pathways. In this regard, cocktails of immunomodulatory drugs, such as monoclonal antibody targeting a specific cytokine (e.g. TNF-inhibitors, IL-1-inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone), and S1PR 1 agonists (e.g. fingolimod), rather than a single drug, might be more effective in the management of COVID-19, by exerting either synergic or additive effects. In this regard, it would be of key importance to assess whether patients with immune-mediated disorders treated with immunomodulatory drugs, such as cytokine blockers, are more resistant to the excessive immune response observed in COVID-19 patients and more protected against SARS-CoV-2-driven pneumonia. However, to date, no evidence reporting either decreased or increased risk of SARS-CoV-driven pneumonia has been documented in this patients and further investigations are required to verify this hypothesis.',\n",
       " 'For symptomatic treatment, the anti-convulsant class of medications may offer benefit with least risk of medication interactions and side effects. Careful attention to signs of hepatitis or kidney injury should be noted since severe cases of COVID-19 have multi-organ involvement [1] . Additionally, the CGRP monoclonal antibodies for migraine prevention may play an important role in reducing acute headache severity given relatively fast onset of action compared to other oral preventive medications. In this case, an early dose of fremanezumab 225 mg was given and was felt to be safe since alternative dosing is 675 mg every 3 months. It should also be noted that the initial management of patients with COVID-19 is likely to occur in the emergency department. Per American Headache Society guidelines, the medications with the highest level of evidence for the treatment of migraine in the emergency department are prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and subcutaneous sumatriptan [12] . Though the consensus on the use of these medications refers to a primary headache disorder, in the early treatment of patients with COVID-19, a secondary headache may not be fully realized. Respiratory status, level of sedation, and QTc should be monitored during treatment due to co-administration of QTc prolonging medications such as hydroxychloroquine and cardiac sequelae of COVID-19 [13, 14] . As described in this case, rescue therapies may be ineffective and preventive therapies need to be optimized. A limitation to this case report is that CSF analysis was not performed; however, we are the first to report how to manage acute treatment-refractory headache in a patient with COVID-19. Overall, this case speaks to the need for more objective data regarding the treatment of seriously ill patients with COVID-19.',\n",

However, its potential cardiotoxicity and still unclear benefit have eventually urged caution. 2 High fatality rates have been reported in elderly individuals with COVID-19 and multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. 3 Concerns have arisen that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might increase ACE2 receptor expression and patient susceptibility to viral entry into host cells, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 propagation. 4 Recent studies with different designs found no adverse effects associated with ACEIs/ARBs in various large populations with COVID-19 but did not report on HCQ coadministration. 5 We analyzed 1031 patients admitted to the Hospital of Cremona, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, between February 22 and April 7, 2020, and followed up until May 3, 2020.',\n",

Intriguingly, during HCQ coadministration, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with lower hazards of mortality and the need for invasive ventilation, reinforcing previous findings of their lack of detriment in COVID-19. 5 In a setting similar to ours, Geleris et al. 6 found no association of HCQ treatment with a higher or lower risk of intubation or death.

       " 'Introduction Recent attention on the possible use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 disease has potentially triggered a number of overdoses from hydroxychloroquine. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine manifests with cardiac conduction abnormalities, seizure activity, and muscle weakness. Recognizing this toxidrome and unique management of this toxicity is important in the COVID-19 pandemic. Case Report A 27-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department 7 hours after an intentional overdose of hydroxychloroquine. Initial presentation demonstrated proximal muscle weakness. The patient was found to have a QRS complex of 134 ms and QTc of 710 ms. He was treated with early orotracheal intubation and intravenous diazepam boluses. Due to difficulties formulating continuous diazepam infusions, we opted to utilize an intermitted intravenous bolus strategy that achieved similar effects that a continuous infusion would. The patient recovered without residual side effects.

       " 'Hydroxychloroquine is an orally administered 4aminoquinone, which was first synthesized by introducing a hydroxyl group to chloroquine and was demonstrated to be about 40% less toxic than chloroquine in animal models [10] . Given its lower toxicity and more readily availability, hydroxychloroquine is preferred in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. Nonetheless, the two drugs have similar structural, therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological properties. Therefore, prolonged hydroxychloroquine use or overdose may have potentially fatal depressant effects on the myocardium, similar to those caused by chloroquine [11] . As a result, the two drugs have nearly identical clinical features of poisoning, and recommended management is the same for both drugs [12] . Following oral administration, absorption is rapid and near-complete; rapid distribution in the body lead to cardiac and neurotoxicity effects that develop as rapidly as 30 minutes after ingestion. It has a large volume of distribution (5522 L), is metabolized in the liver, and renally excreted [13] .',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigenpresenting cells and decreases toll-like receptor signaling, features that make it an attractive drug for chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine inhibits glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor thought to facilitate entry of SARS-nCoV-2 into cells [1, 3] . Recently, the ability of hydroxychloroquine to downregulate this inflammatory pathway was postulated to improve survival in individuals with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-nCoV-2 [3] . Hydroxychloroquine exerts its toxicity through blockade of cardiac and cerebral sodium channels. This competitive blockade is potent, resulting in depolarization delays in cardiac myocytes and manifesting as a widened QRS complex over 100 ms on ECG. In large doses, hydroxychloroquine also binds cerebral sodium channels, resulting in epileptiform seizures, and in skeletal muscle, resulting in weakness. Death occurs in the setting of ventricular dysrhythmias and intractable seizures.',\n",

Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug concentrations are unavailable immediately and are not helpful in guiding treatment. An ECG should be obtained to assess for effects of sodium channel blockade and hypokalemia. The history, presence of key physical exam features, hypokalemia (U waves), a prolonged QRS complex, and QTc interval on ECG should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of poisoning from hydroxychloroquine.',\n",
       " 'Treatment of moderate and severe hydroxychloroquine poisoning centers has two predominant features. First, supportive care and airway management, including IV crystalloid volume resuscitation, is important to permit renal clearance of hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, early orotracheal intubation in individuals with muscle weakness or seizures may improve survival [8, 9] . In individuals who have mild poisoning exhibited by mild hypokalemia and some QTc prolongation without sedation or weakness, aggressive supportive care with potassium replacement and close monitoring of the QTc on telemetry may suffice.',\n",
       " 'Replacement of potassium should occur early in the clinical course, as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine overdoses may cause profound hypokalemia. This can be confounded and exacerbated if sodium bicarbonate infusions are initiated to maintain QRS < 100 ms and/or epinephrine infusion to maintain adequate systolic arterial pressure. In our case, the severe hypokalemia predated any initiation of treatment with these agents, further supporting the causal relationship of hypokalemia with hydroxychloroquine intoxication. Most institutions have IV electrolyte replacement guidelines that limit the amount of parenteral potassium replacement in a given period. However, traditional IV replacement pathways may be inadequate to counteract the synergistic effect of hydroxychloroquine intoxication and treatment-induced hypokalemia; additional oral potassium may be needed on an ad hoc basis-together with frequent monitoring-to ensure serum concentrations are sufficiently raised and minimize the risk of ventricular dysrhythmias (Fig. 1) . Post-poisoning monitoring should include assessment for hyperkalemia after intracellular potassium shifts occur.

Although the mechanism by which diazepam addresses cardiac conduction abnormalities from hydroxychloroquine is controversial, animal models of chloroquine overdose demonstrate that when diazepam is administered, whole blood concentrations of chloroquine increase, while cardiac myocyte concentrations of chloroquine decrease [16] . This suggests that diazepam may mediate displacement of chloroquine from sodium channels in the heart [15] .',\n",

Numerous agents used in patients or proposed for use include hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, nitazoxanide, lopinavirritonavir, remdesivir, corticosteroids, and tocilizumab, among others. As data are presented in the public domain -often without peer review given the urgency of the crisis -providers should exercise caution when using medications \"off label\" given the extensive side effect profile and questionable efficacy of some of these agents. As an example, several reports suggesting benefits of hydroxychloroquine were retracted or were on retraction watch [42, 43] .',\n",

CDC guidelines now recommend against its use, highlighting the danger of hasty adoption. IL-6 blocking agents such as tocilizumab are at the forefront of expanding literature on potential therapies for COVID-19 patients. Although a pro-inflammatory \"cytokine storm\" is often invoked as a rationale for blocking the IL-6 cytokine in COVID-19, IL-6 has significant antiinflammatory properties. This calls into question the rationale of using IL-6 antagonists as an inflammation-reducing therapy. Studies also indicate IL-6 is crucial in the early host immune response to infection, and thus it is not obvious IL-6 blockade is a sound strategy to treat an infection. Elevated levels of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 are often no higher than levels observed in patients with autoimmune diseases, and exogenous administration of extremely large doses of IL-6 has not resulted in serious adverse effects, raising doubt that IL-6 is a causative cytokine in COVID-19 pulmonary or systemic injury. Finally, clinical use of IL-6 antagonists in autoimmune conditions is associated with increased risk of severe and opportunistic infections. This observation raises concern that IL-6 blockade, in addition to being unlikely to benefit COVID-19 patients, may also prove harmful.',\n",

It is the successor infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) named as SARS-CoV-2 causing a disease called as . Being one of the most severe diseases in terms of transmission, this disease agitates the immune system of an individual quite disturbingly which at times leads to death, which is why it has become the need of the hour to step forward to extensively involve in understanding the genetics, pathogenesis, and immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 in order to design drugs to treat or to design a vaccine to prevent. In this chapter, we have tried to review and summarize the studies done so far to understand the host-pathogen relationship and the host immune response during COVID-19 infection. One of the recent developments regarding the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the mechanism of immune evasion involved during the pathogenesis and cytokine storm syndrome during infection in the patient against which a drug called as Hydroxychloroquine has been designed. Comprehensively, we have tried to give an immunological insight into the SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to understand the possible outcome for any therapeutic advancement.',\n",

Among these, antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, lopinavir, and ritonavir were recommended based on the experience in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome. 22 Some studies are suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatments reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. 10, 23 Animal studies and early clinical experience with the use of remdesivir in adults are promising, and extensive randomized controlled studies are underway to assess the effectiveness of this treatment. 24 The role of corticosteroids has not been proven yet; while current international consensus and WHO are against the use of corticosteroids, the Chinese guidelines recommend a shortterm treatment with low to medium dose corticosteroids in COVID-19. 25, 26 Other therapeutics recommended for treatment are umifenovir (an antiviral drug available in Russia and China) and intravenous immunoglobulins, interferons, and the administration of plasma isolated from the patients who had previously recovered from COVID-19. 27,28 However, there is still a need for more evidence to recommend these therapies.',\n",

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial that has become a mainstay in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Similar to chloroquine in structure, hydroxychloroquine is used more frequently because it confers lower toxicity. Cardiotoxicity manifests as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or with conduction system abnormalities such as atrioventricular and bundle-branch block (43) . Recently, some doubts It is important also to note that some chemotherapeutic agents or hormonal therapies such as abiraterone require concomitant steroids that are immunosuppressive agents and could weaken anticitokines drugs such as tocilizumab (63) .

Tocilizumab decreases concentrations of many anticancer drugs due to interference with CYP (64).',\n",
       " 'Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8 + lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8 + and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8 + cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8 + cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8 + T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD + T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon α, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.',\n",
       " 'We propose that COVID-19 infection severely compromises the hosts innate immune response, and ability to generate a sufficient adaptive immune response. We also propose that such suppression of the innate immune response occurs via over-expression of NKG2A (an inhibitory receptor) on CD8 + and NK cells, leading to their reduction and an increase in opportunistic and coinfections of the lung in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. We posit that such severe symptoms could perhaps be alleviated by treatment with Monalizumab, a drug that has successfully cleared Phase 2 clinical trials, by inhibtiing NKG2A receptors and restoring CD8 + T and NK cell function as previously recorded in a number of cancers. Finally, perhaps a combination of Chloroquine, antivirals, interferons, and broad-based antibiotics can prevent co-infections and severe infections of the lung which culminates in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure.',\n",

Recent pediatric data suggest that existing World Health Organization (WHO) dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal. The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19. A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44 mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 70 hours (AUC 0-70h ) the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared with adults. Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient. Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses. The knowledge-driven, model-informed dose selection paradigm can serve as a science-based alternative to recommend pediatric dosing when pediatric clinical trial data is absent.',\n",
       " 'Till date, only one recent paper addressed the relationship between vitamin D levels and the clinical outcomes of patients with Covid-19 [65] . The author conducted a multinomial logistic regression to explore the association between serum 25(OH)D level and clinical outcomes of 212 cases with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, serum 25(OH)D proved to be a predictor of severe (OR 0.126, p < 0.001) and critical (OR 0.051, p < 0.001) Covid-19. A recent review proposes the supplementation of vitamin D in Covid-19 patients based on the promising findings of RCTs conducted in other viral infections [66] . According to the emerging relationship between vitamin D status and alleged Covid-19 infection, vitamin D supplementation has already been proposed elsewhere [67] . Although we do not assume that vitamin D plays a role in the pathogenesis of Covid-19, we do believe that its putative role in preventing or even treating the disease urgently needs to be further addressed. At the moment of writing, an interventional randomized clinical trial has been proposed at the University of Granada, with enrollment of 200 participants, proposing vitamin D supplementations (a single dose of 25,000 UI of vitamin D) in preventing and treating mild forms of suspected Covid-19 [68] . In a recent paper, it is assumed that vitamin D prophylaxis (without overdosing) could reduce, especially in patients with hypovitaminosis D, the severity of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 [69] . The importance of treating the hypovitaminosis D along with an early nutritional supplementation has been highlighted for the potential preventing role of malnutrition sequelae in these patients [70] . On the basis of the possible direct and indirect effect of vitamin D on immune system and cytokines production, we speculate a possible influence of this vitamin on the immunologic response to the virus and/or a modulating effect on the drugs being administered, namely hydroxychloroquine and anti-IL 6 and anti-IL 1 agents.',\n",

There are currently no evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis, but unfortunately these data are being extrapolated to the indication potentially resulting in drug shortages for patients with rheumatic diseases who require this medication. Furthermore, we caution medical and world leaders against premature comments of treatment efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such comments may exacerbate shortages for patients reliant on these medications or cause harm due to medication side effects and overdose [8] .',\n",

Does azithromycin treatment decrease the expression of MMPs and possibly CD147, reducing SARS-CoV-2 invasion? Both Plasmodium falciparum causing Malaria and SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 are susceptive to hydroxychloroquine treatment; however, are both pathogens also susceptible to azithromycin because they need of the CD147 protein for cell invasion? Can resident progenitor/stem cells be targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or affected in their differentiation capabilities? Can effects of immunomodulatory and anti-viral response of MCSs and azithromycin, respectively, be therapeutically exploited CODIV-19 treatment?

COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.',\n",

This has led to the initiation of Phase II and Phase III studies of tocilizumab in these patients [23] . Other anti-inflammatory therapeutics, including glucocorticoids, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, may also improve patients\\' prognosis [24] . It should be noted, however, that the ability of glucocorticoids to block production of the potentially most dangerous cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, occurs largely at the genomic level therefore requiring several hours for effective manifestation. This hampers the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapies in catastrophic situations where high amounts of these cytokines have already been released to the circulation. In contrast, specific anti-cytokine antibodies or receptor antagonists clinical approved on other indications would be expected to have an immediate neutralizing effect that might reduce mortality.',\n",
       " 'The identification of the precise pathogenic mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces organ damage are of immediate urgency. Unfortunately, emerging data seem to indicate that other organs such as heart, kidney and the central nervous system may also be attacked, albeit in a more silent fashion, by SARS-CoV-2 [25, 26] . Indeed, patients may show proteinuria, elevated baseline serum creatinine levels and hematuria [25] , as well as neurological symptoms, that include headache, epilepsy, disturbed consciousness, anosmia and dysgeusia [26] . Some COVID-19 patients also develop a thrombogenic diathesis that is characterized by marked elevation of D-dimer and other procoagulant parameters diverging from those observed during SARS infections [27] . Thus, anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy [28] . Understanding whether or not a cytokine storm also contributes to damage to these organs or if other pathogenetic mechanisms operate is clearly needed to develop organ-tailored therapeutic approaches. While waiting for the eventual advent of a vaccine, other drugs used for different indications may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients, as well. These include a few antiviral options under clinical trial, e.g. remdesivir [29] , and lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or in combination with interferon-and hydroxychloroquine alone or with azithromycin (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04332107; NCT04339816; NCT04336332; NCT04332094; NCT04335552; NCT04322123).',\n",

In some countries, including Spain and Italy, national guidelines were encouraging the use of hydroxychloroquine for selected cases, as reflected in our data, while in other countries, recommendations were more guarded regarding the use of antiviral agents in the absence of robust human data. An expert consensus statement from the USA has emphasised that antiviral treatment should be reserved for patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum, ideally within a clinical trial. 31 Overall, the expert panel appeared to favour the use of remdesivir over other agents, based on the currently available data from invitro and animal studies, including in non-human primates, and recent data from compassionate use in humans. 32, 33 The panel members' opinion was split regarding the use of lopinavir-ritonavir, given the disappointing results of a recently published randomised controlled trial. 34 The main limitation of this study relates to the number of variables for which data were collected. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure high levels of participation and avoid diverting substantial time away from clinical front-line duties, a decision was made not to collect detailed data on laboratory parameters or ICU interventions. A further limitation was that a variety of inhouse and commercial PCR assays were used across different participating centres, precluding an assessment of diagnostic test performance. Also, the number of children receiving antiviral or immunomodulatory treatment was too small to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their effectiveness, which will be addressed by the aforementioned randomised trials. A further limitation is that different countries were using different thresholds to screen for SARS-CoV-2 at the time the study was done, with some recommending screening of all children admitted to hospital or conducting community screening, whereas others were using more selective testing strategies. Despite those limitations, to our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive overview on COVID-19 in children and adolescents to date.\",\n",

Another reason for the high frequency is that this attractive topic was presented in almost all of the videos provided by news agencies.

However, Italy presents a lower proportion of elderly persons living in retirement homes and, in our experience, there have been no difficulties in finding these data. Another further limitation is that the study focused on the influence of underlying health conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis of gender-and age-related lethality could be the subject of further studies. On the other hand, the studies in this first phase of pandemic are fundamental in order to fully understand the role of comorbidity in the risk of death. In fact, recent acquisitions of knowledge in the therapeutic field, such as the efficacy of the use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, low molecular weight heparin, etc., tend to significantly alter the risk of death with SARS-Cov2 infection [24, 25] . Moreover, several further strengths may be identified. Firstly, the peculiar characteristics of Sardinian history made its population optimal for case-control studies.

       " 'Safe and efficient drugs to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic are urgently needed. In this context, we have analyzed the anti-coronavirus potential of the natural product glycyrrhizic acid (GLR), a drug used to treat liver diseases (including viral hepatitis) and specific cutaneous inflammation (such as atopic dermatitis) in some countries. The properties of GLR and its primary active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid are presented and discussed. GLR has shown activities against different viruses, including SARS-associated Human and animal coronaviruses. GLR is a non-hemolytic saponin and a potent immuno-active anti-inflammatory agent which displays both cytoplasmic and membrane effects. At the membrane level, GLR induces cholesterol -dependent disorganization of lipid rafts which are important for the entry of coronavirus into cells. At the intracellular and circulating levels, GLR can trap the high mobility group box 1 protein and thus blocks the alarmin functions of HMGB1. We used molecular docking to characterize further and discuss both the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 2 cholesterol-and HMG box-binding functions of GLR. The membrane and cytoplasmic effects of GLR, coupled with its long-established medical use as a relatively safe drug, make GLR a good candidate to be tested against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, alone and in combination with other drugs. The rational supporting combinations with (hydroxy)chloroquine and tenofovir (two drugs active against SARS-CoV-2) is also discussed. Based on this analysis, we conclude that GLR should be further considered and rapidly evaluated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.',\n",

       " 'During SARS-CoV-2 infection, white blood count and coagulation disturbances have been reported, particularly in the form of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. These thrombocytopenias are usually moderate (>100×10 9 /l) except in patients with multi-organ failure with ARDS or capillary leak syndrome (>50×10 9 /l) [1] . The patients described above developed sudden and potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenia. The usual causes of secondary and primary thrombocytopenia were eliminated. The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia was retained based on clinical and biological findings according to the consensus of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [2] . However, it is important to highlight that immune thrombocytopenia remains a diagnosis of exclusion and that in the context of the coronavirus, other causes of thrombocytopenia such as antiphospholipid syndrome [3] and thrombotic microangiopathy must be considered. The severity of thrombocytopenia led us to consider immediate intravenous immunoglobulin administration and eltrombopag. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was discussed, in view of its potential effectiveness in patients with SARS-CoV-2 [4] and immune thrombocytopenias [5] , but in the end was not considered. In patients infected with COVID-19, the mechanisms leading to thrombocytopenia seem to be multifactorial: direct infection of bone marrow cells leading to abnormal haematopoiesis, or an autoimmune response against blood cells [1, 6] . In addition, as patients develop ARDS, platelet count could decrease as the lung is an important site of platelet release from fully mature megakaryocytes, a process impaired by ARDS [7] . Treatment options for this entity have evolved and current protocols include rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, avatrombopag, romiplostim), and high-dose dexamethasone as an alternative to prednisone [4] . Corticosteroids are the standard initial treatment for adults with immune thrombocytopenia who need treatment if there is no contraindication. The use of IVIg (1 g/kg on 1 or 2 consecutive days or 0.4 g/kg per day for 5 days) or intravenous anti-D (50-75 mg/kg once) where available, may be appropriate in patients with bleeding, or at high risk for bleeding, who are unresponsive to predniso(lo)ne. If anti-D is used, consideration must be given to potential triggering of DIC or haemolysis [8] . The use of platelet growth factors should be carefully evaluated taking into account the potential thrombotic events during coronavirus infection. Platelet transfusion is reserved for refractory visceral or cerebral meningeal haemorrhage. In conclusion, severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be encountered in the course of COVID-19 infection. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or thrombopoietin receptor agonists has been shown to be effective.',\n",

Plasma treatment, by isolating antibodies from recovered patients and administering it to new patients in a controlled manner, is likely to be promising. Several drugs that were initially developed for other diseases have also been tried with patients, as well as tested in cell culture experiments, among which several antibody-based immunosuppressive drugs, the anti-CoV drug remdesivir, the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine, and the anti-HIV drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown promising results. These drugs are therefore the subjects of further investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. There is also an initiative to repurpose anti-HIV PIs using unique drug delivery systems that utilize natural nanocarriers, EVs. These EV-encapsulated drugs have the ability to bypass liver metabolism and target diseased tissues, enhancing their efficacy and reducing off-target effects or drug toxicity.',\n",

Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide.

       " 'Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven by \"cytokine storms\" and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given this unexpected clinical association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.',\n",
       " 'To understand how corticosteroids either benefited or not the inflammation-induced respiratory distress among the ICU patients, we plotted plasma IL-6 levels versus ICU durations for patients on corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid therapies (antivirals, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab).

The objective of this report is to describe a rural healthcare system's utilisation of therapeutic options available to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent patient outcomes. A total of 150 patients were treated for COVID-19 at three hospitals in the Dakotas from 21 March 2020 to 30 April 2020. The most common pharmacological treatment regimens administered were zinc, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and convalescent plasma. Adjunctive treatments included therapeutic anticoagulation, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. As of 1 June 2020, 127 patients have survived to hospital discharge, 12 patients remain hospitalised and 11 patients have expired. The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use has yet to be determined but was not without risks of corrected QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias in our cohort. We did not appreciate any adverse effects that appeared related to tocilizumab or convalescent plasma administration in those patient subsets. These findings may provide insight into disease severity and treatment options in the rural setting with limited resources to participate in clinical trials and encourage larger comparative studies evaluating treatment efficacy.\",\n",
       " \"The high expression of ACE2 in the ileum suggests it as a potential target of the virus in the GI tract. Additionally, mild to moderate elevation of aminotransferases has been reported in 20% to 50% of the cases. Although acute liver failure has not been reported as a direct consequence of severe COVID-19, the extent of abnormal liver tests seems to be associated with disease severity and worse outcomes. It is important to note that medications used for management of COVID-19, such as chloroquine or Lopinavir-Ritonavir can be associated with varying degrees of liver test abnormalities and GI adverse reactions. It is important to obtain a baseline evaluation of patients' liver function before initiation of treatment and continue to monitor liver function tests during the treatment. It is also important to check patients for presence of chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, and HCV), as well as risk factors for chronic liver disease especially alcohol use before starting the treatment with these agents. In addition to direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 and similar to any other patients with severe illness, these patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants such as C. difficile infection in context of frequent antibiotic use, and ischemic liver injury or cholestasis of critical illness. As detailed above, delaying endoscopic procedures in non-urgent cases, and strict adherence to hand hygiene, contact precautions, and correct use of PPE will help minimize the risk of exposure and transmission during COVID-19 pandemic and conserve health-care resources.\",\n",

       " 'Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes high morbidity and mortality in older adults with chronic illnesses. Several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection. However, polypharmacy predisposes patients to increased risk of drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine and may render many in this population ineligible to participate in trials.',\n",
       " 'We re-analyzed data from the MedSafer pilot and found that 1 in 2 older adults with polypharmacy in our cohort have a chronically prescribed medication that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine, half of which were PIMs that could be deprescribed. The number of medical conditions and associated polypharmacy of the cohort places them at high risk of complications from COVID-19, but also potentially at risk of harm from treatments. We identified several common drug classes, many of which are also PIMs, that would preclude many older adults from enrolling in a trial. A main finding was that many older adults were taking medications that carry a known risk of prolonging the QTc. This finding should caution against routine prescribing of QTc prolonging COVID-19 treatments outside of a clinical study, as there is real potential for harm. Importantly, more than 50% of interacting drugs were identified as a PIM that could be proactively deprescribed, rendering the person more likely to be eligible for a trial, and increasing the generalizability of study findings to this population.',\n",
       " 'In this analysis, we chose to focus on a specific drug, hydroxychloroquine. Of note, there is ongoing debate regarding the safety of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 and studies into efficacy are still ongoing. The risks associated with a medication such as hydroxychloroquine are likely higher for older adults with polypharmacy, especially given how common co-administration of QTc prolonging medications is and the prevalence of underlying cardiac conditions. 41 Many patients in our cohort were also overprescribed oral hypoglycemic agents (a1c <7.5% or a history of hypoglycemia), which when co-prescribed with hydroxychloroquine, could increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Older adults may have decreased oral intake as a result of COVID-19 infection and subsequent dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, nausea, and GI upset, which are also common adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine and may further exacerbate severe cardiac dysrhythmias. 42 We have identified medications that may interact with study drugs that could be deprescribed proactively or at the time of treatment (e.g. off-label low dose quetiapine for sleep and agitation). Others, if stopped abruptly, could lead to serious adverse drug withdrawal events or uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms (e.g. methadone or higher doses of SSRIs). 43 Finally, some medications have long half-lives that require weeks to months to safely discontinue in order to avoid interactions, in this case, it may not be possible to stop the medication in time for treatment and thus the risk of interaction will not be reduced (e.g. azithromycin 44 , fluoxetine, and amiodarone). Of note, while there is a risk of potential interactions between medications, this does not necessarily mean there will be any clinical manifestations.',\n",
       " 'Currently, the use of antimalarials for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 has extremely limited evidence. 27 If robust evidence demonstrating efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is established, some clinicians might opt to continue certain medications that cannot be stopped abruptly, or where symptoms of withdrawal are thought to be significant. In most cases, this would involve judicious monitoring of the QTc and minimizing other risk factors (electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia). While cardiac monitoring is generally available for hospitalized patients, and perhaps at select nursing homes, this is likely not the case for most outpatients. Finally, it is important to take into consideration the half-life of the treatment medication to know how long symptoms should be monitored for and when it is safe to re-start medications (hydroxychloroquine, range: 20-120 days; mean: 40 days). [45] [46] [47] The risk of QTc prolongation may persist beyond the treatment period and remain clinically relevant for an unclear duration. Of note, the optimal effective does of hydroxychloroquine is not known.',\n",
       " 'While our referenced study uses a daily dose of 600mg, in practice doses are variable, and some jurisdictions may prescribe lower doses of 400 mg daily, and this may have an impact on the risk of drug interactions and of side effects. The above considerations aside, for medications that are PIMs, their interactions with possible COVID-19 therapies are yet another reason to evaluate these medications for safe deprescribing immediately. 48 Any concern for abrupt discontinuation can be avoided by deprescribing in advance of acute illness. 48 While we used hydroxychloroquine as a test case, this should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the medication. The clinical scenario described herein is not limited to hydroxychloroquine. Other treatments including but not limited to lopinavir-ritonavir, colchicine, and dapsone have also been proposed. These treatments similarly do not have significant evidence to support their use presently, but also carry risks of serious drug-drug interactions. 49, 50 Clinicians may be tempted and indeed are prescribing medications out of desperation to provide patients with some form of treatment for COVID-19, but caution and a rigorous review of possible interactions is warranted, especially in older adults with polypharmacy. Notably, this population will often be underrepresented in clinical trials and even if proven effective, harms may still outweigh benefits for some therapies and an individualized approach should always be taken. Presently, while some medications have shown promise, such as hydroxychloroquine and more recently remdesivir 49 , no medication for the treatment of COVID-19 has been proven to be effective and so we would suggest that outside of a clinical trial, the potential harms of off-label prescribing likely outweigh benefits. In the meantime, it is important that we reduce the number of PIMs patients are taking, as it may facilitate more treatment options once clinical evidence is established.',\n",
       " 'Strengths of this study include a large cohort of older adults from a multi-site trial with polypharmacy, a thorough review of the literature to outline potential drug interactions, and clear instructions for medication management in the setting of drug interactions. This cohort also reflects the latest FDA recommendation that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a clinical trial or a hospitalized setting. 14 Yet, our study has several limitations. As they were all hospitalized, the patients in this study likely represent those that are most likely to experience harm as a result of widespread prescribing of hydroxychloroquine. Future work should focus on finding safe and effective treatments in long-term care facilities where the burden of polypharmacy is high, there is an increased risk for COVID-19 exposure and effective treatments may decrease the risk of hospitalization. We chose to focus on hydroxychloroquine as a test case in order to provide realistic examples of harm that could result from widespread prescribing; reviewing all potential therapies and their subsequent drug-drug interactions was beyond the scope of this paper. However, similar recommendations could be generated for other potential treatments and may be more complex. For example, interactions with the lopinavir-ritonavir are more extensive than we have outlined for hydroxychloroquine.',\n",

A systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of 38 research articles on COVID-19 are conducted. An integrated Research focus parallel-ship network and keyword co-occurrence analysis are carried out to visualize the three research concepts in COVID-19 literature.

The common symptoms include shortness of breath, fever, sputum production, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle or joint pain, nasal congestion, headache, chills, and diarrhoea. The intervention and mitigation strategies implemented by the governments against the spread of COVID-19 are city lockdown, border closing, strengthening the surveillance to identify the imported COVID-19 cases from other countries, establishing adequate medical team on a rotation basis, reducing patient attendance in hospitals by rescheduling non-critical surgeries, providing e-health care to public, suspicious accidents monitoring, contract tracking and improved airport security hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, universal masking, and creating transparency and public access to disease data using maps/cartograms. For eradication of the COVID-19, the following drugs and treatment plans are proposed in the literature.

       " 'Numerous medications are under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. The role of interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19 has yet to be determined with clinical trials underway. 18 Accordingly, expert consensus was reached only in the scenario of continuing tocilizumab in otherwise healthy patients with NIU. Although tocilizumab improves visual acuity and reduces intraocular inflammation in NIU, 19 the use of tocilizumab for NIU in a patient with COVID-19 is unknown. Evidence of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 remains controversial with the need for randomised controlled trials to assess effectiveness. 20 The uncertain utility of hydroxychloroquine is reflected in the survey, as uveitis specialists only reached consensus for maintaining hydroxychloroquine in those patients who are already on the medication.',\n",
       " 'The potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of patients with COVID-19 had been hypothesised, potentially acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Hydroxychloroquine may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediate the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of COVID-19. 28 IL-6 seems to have a crucial role in the pro-inflammatory storm and subsequent disease progress, because high levels of IL-6 have been demonstrated to be predictive of severe pneumonia. 29 30 Thus, interference with the IL-6 pathway might be a potential therapeutic strategy, and tocilizumab, a recombinant humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 signal transduction, has been proven effective in limited clinical trials in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. 11 Our study is limited by the lack of evidence-based literature regarding immunosuppression during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the urgent need for guidance on immunosuppression during the COVID-19 pandemic, expert opinions of uveitis specialists represent an important source for consensus statements. Our survey reports the expert opinions of uveitis specialists from six continents. At the time of the survey, some countries had not experienced major outbreaks and thus specialist survey responses may change over time as the number of COVID-19 cases increase in those regions. Also, NIU is a category of many complex diseases, each with its own distinct clinical course, visual outcomes and requirement for various treatments. In particular, some NIU (eg, Behçet or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease) may not tolerate rapid reduction in IMT without visual loss, which could end up being permanent. Therefore, these guidelines may not apply to all diseases equally within the category of NIU, and uveitis specialists need to assess each individual patient in their particular situation.',\n",
       " 'Different dosage regimens of hydroxychloroquine are used to manage COVID-19 patients, without information on the pharmacokinetics in this population.',\n",
       " 'The concentrations measured in COVID-19 patients show that hydroxychloroquine exposure tends to be low and in most instances lower than the values reported in SLE patients, in particular for the standard regimen of \"200 mg x 3/day\". These preliminary results confirm that the pharmacokinetic behavior in COVID-19 patients cannot be predicted by the SLE population or by rheumatoid arthritis patients as recently reported by Perinel et al [8] . Furthermore, given the apparently large volume of distribution of hydroxychloroquine, Morita\\'s model [6] , which is based on plasma concentrations, presents a major limitation for accurately predicting hydroxychloroquine accumulation in deep tissue. It is a major additional argument to urgently assess hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics in COVID-19 patients using both blood and plasma matrices. Moreover, monitoring hydroxychloroquine concentrations in bronchoalveolar fluids of COVID-19 patients could provide additional information on the degree of hydroxychloroquine lung impregnation [9, 10] for a short period of treatment (i.e. few days). In fact, data exist from lung tissue [11] and BAL [12] for antibiotics such as macrolides that accumulate in deep tissues. Therefore, it would be logical to consider BAL as \"quality control\" that provides information on the degree of hydroxychloroquine exposure in the lung.',\n",
       " 'There is no established efficacy threshold for the moment. Therefore, the only relevant element to take into account when monitoring hydroxychloroquine concentrations seems to be toxicity and more precisely cardiotoxicity. A number of arguments suggest that a plasma concentration of 1 mg/l should not be exceeded, as initially suggested by the French National Team, AC43-ANRS/STP-SFPT. However, this concentration should be interpreted with caution because COVID-19 patients may (i) receive co-prescriptions which can worsen the cardiotoxicity of hydroxychloroquine (for example, azithromycin), (ii) have preexisting heart problems along with COVID-19 (EMA/202483/2020) and/or (iii) have hypokalemia.If this is the case, monitoring for heart problems by placing patients on telemetry to track EKG over the course of treatment, as is the current practice for ICU patients or at the University of Washington Medical Center [13] , is not an option to be overlooked. M a n u s c r i p t 5 On April 2 nd 2020, for an unknown reason, the French Ministry of Health imposed a dosage regimen identical to that used in SLE (no loading dose and 200 mg x 3/day) for patients treated outside the context of a clinical trial. Given (i) the variability of the physiopathological status of COVID-19 patients, (ii) the complex tissue distribution kinetics of hydroxychloroquine and (iii) the hydroxychloroquine concentration required to clear 100% of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (≈ 7 mg/l) [13] , it does not seem reasonable to impose the same dosing regimen on the entire COVID-19 population without any further pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information.',\n",

Besides hydroxychloroquine, other risky drugs include lopinavir/ritonavir (administered in all 3 cases), azithromycin (case 3) and levofloxacin (case 1) may lead to (TdP) [14] .

It is recommended to repeat the ECG on the third to fifth day of therapy. Prolongation of QT C intervals in the first and second case (480 and 500 msec, respectively) could be due to inflammatory activation (besides pre-existing risk factors, specifically diabetes and chronic heart failure in patient 2). Thus, it is plausible that a further QT C increase occurred after starting drug assumption, possibly reaching critical levels to favor TdP and SCD.',\n",

Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management. The only FDA approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir, and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon and colchicine. PURPOSE: To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the illness and its proposed treatments.',\n",
       " \"While there are no absolute contraindications to use of psychotropics in COVID-19 patients, psychiatrists must be mindful of potential adverse effects and conduct a thoughtful risk-benefit analysis as part of their clinical decision-making process. For example, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin have the potential for QT prolongation, which can be problematic in patients with tenuous cardiac status. Generally, psychiatrists might avoid antipsychotic medications in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. However, in our experience, hyperactive delirium in COVID-19 patients is highly prevalent and manifests with severe agitation that can be difficult to treat and leads to dangerous behaviors such as removing oxygen or assaulting staff. While there is limited evidence to support the use of any interventions in the management of agitation in COVID-19 associated delirium, most CL psychiatrists consider antipsychotics such as haloperidol the gold standard for managing agitation in delirious patients. In these situations, the CL psychiatrist should assist the medical team in reasoning through the cardiac risks of using an antipsychotic balanced against effective management of the agitation. Use of an antipsychotic with cardiology involvement and frequent EKG monitoring or telemetry may be deemed acceptable. Alternatives such as alpha-2 agonists (dexmedetomidine and clonidine) or anti-epileptics (valproic acid) should be considered if the individual patient's cardiac risk is determined to be high and/or if the antipsychotic is clinically ineffective. Melatonin has been proposed for addressing consciousness and sleep-wake cycle disturbances in delirious COVID-19 patients, especially given its potential for anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects (83) . With the exception of patients who chronically use alcohol or benzodiazepines and may be at risk for withdrawal, benzodiazepines should be avoided if possible and considered only as a last resort for highly agitated delirious patients for whom other treatments are unavailable or ineffective. Early delirium screening and non-pharmacological strategies to prevent or treat delirium such as frequent orientation and early mobilization should be employed if practically feasible (24) .\",\n",
       " 'Other important tasks for the psychiatrist treating a COVID-19 patient include review of all medications, monitoring for neuropsychiatric side effects of medications such as hydroxychloroquine or corticosteroids and differentiating between primary psychiatric symptoms versus those that are secondary to COVID-19 or other medications.',\n",

COVID-19 is neither an air-borne nor water-borne disease; it spreads from infected individuals to others through respiratory droplets while sneezing or coughing, and through contaminated hands. The incubation period has been reported to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4-7) [12] , however the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests it can range from 2 to 14 days [13] . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with one-third of patients experiencing dyspnoea [7, 8] . Other symptoms include myalgia, headache, sore throat, and diarrhoea [8] . Moreover, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases) and healthcare professionals are at greater risk of COVID-19 [8, 14] . In our study, most participants knew the mode of transmission of COVID-19, 55.3% were aware of its incubation period, 93.7% knew the common symptoms, and 72% were aware of high-risk individuals. To date, management of COVID-19 has been largely supportive. Several drugs approved for other indications (e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, sofosbovir, ribavirin, etc.) and some investigational drugs (e.g. remdesivir, favipiravir) are being investigated to prevent or treat COVID-19 [15] . Surprisingly, ≈ 33% and 54% of study participants were unaware that there was no vaccine and any approved cure for COVID-19, respectively. Overall, it was encouraging to see that the majority of university students and employees had good COVID-19 knowledge and attitudes.

Proposed mechanisms include improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing insulin-dependent glucose transport, and decreasing the degradation of intracellular insulin S1 . A study demonstrated that HCQ could increase insulin secretion and improve blood glucose levels in pre-diabetic patients S2 . Another trial also showed that chloroquine could lower glucose levels in diabetic patients with a similar mechanism S3 . HCQ-induced hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic population is quite rare. Although the exact mechanism is not well-known, a recently published case report showed that HCQ-induced hypoglycemia was associated with increased insulin and C-peptide levels in a non-diabetic patient.',\n",
       " 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, the optimal strategy for the administration of HCQ is unclear. Hence, these protocols showed variability among COVID-19 treatment centers. A previous study has shown that HCQ is more effective than chloroquine if 400 mg is administered on the first day and 200 mg for the next four days S6 . However, the optimal renal dose adjustment strategy of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment is unknown in patients with chronic kidney disease. Some centers recommend 200 mg QD in hemodialysis patients thrice a week after dialysis sessions S7 . All of our patients who developed hypoglycemia were olygoanuric, and we assumed that increased exposure to HCQ caused hypoglycemia due to impaired urinary excretion of the drug in these patients. We did not observe any hypoglycemic events in dialysis patients during pandemic after dose-reduced protocol.',\n",

Repurposing existing drugs can allow for rapid deployment of therapeutics that have already been tested in humans (59) . Remdesivir was developed against the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and was also found to have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 (8) . Importantly, we found that remdesivir is active against SARS-CoV-2 across cell types. Chloroquine and hydroxychlorquine have been used for decades to treat malaria and have been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (8, 9) . However, we find that this antiviral activity is cell-type specific. Lung epithelial cells are resistant to these drugs, and this may explain the lack of efficacy seen in many trials (10) .',\n",

Additionally, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy patients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 increase, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT patients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDI) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc prolonging agents.

       " 'Here we describe a platform created to collect drug and gene sets related to COVID-19 research using various methods of data accrual. All of the top 10 genes associated with COVID-19 are interferon-related (ISG15, IRF7, OAS1, IFITM3, MX1, IFIH1, STAT1, IFIT3, and EIF2AK2). This is consistent with our knowledge that type I (IFN-α, IFN-β) and type III interferon (IFN-λ) systems are the primary defense against viral infections. It has been hypothesized that hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 could drive disease severity and would be amenable to treatment with drugs that reduce inflammation (37) . However, this remains controversial as the high level of antiviral response could be reflective of increased viral burden rather than an inappropriate host response (38) . The most striking result from the meta-analysis applied to the content of the library is the little overlap across drug screen studies. It is expected that experimental validation of drugs to inhibit COVID-19 in-vitro will be more consistent. The inconsistency across these studies could be due to a need to produce results quickly due to the urgency for discovering potential treatments. Regardless, there is some overlap, and there is expectation that more screens will be published and top leads will advance to animal models and human trials for further testing. To prioritize compounds that may treat COVID-19, some researchers have used the strategy of finding drugs that modulate genes related to ACE2 gene expression (39) . We found a highly significant up-regulation of the genes most correlated with ACE2 by chloroquine and related compounds in the L1000 database. This finding suggests that identifying compounds that upregulate genes correlated with ACE2 expression could be a useful approach for identifying more compounds that inhibit COVID-19 in mammalian cells. However, it should be noted that other considerations must be taken into account, including the known side effects for the compounds and whether dosing would allow for high enough drug concentration to achieve therapeutic effects.',\n",
       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are agents which have generated significant interest for treatment in persons with COVID-19 infection. They appear to have an antiviral effect mediated through increasing the endosomal pH thereby impeding virus to cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . Both drugs are known for their long elimination half-life of at least one month and high accumulation rate in cells [7] .',\n",
       " 'Rationale for the use of these antimalarial compounds emerged from experiments in Vero E6 cells. In a recent letter published by Wang and colleagues, the in vitro activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 showed an effective concentration (EC50) at 48 hours of 1.13 μM, indicating potency [8] . Similar studies of chloroquine were previously done on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showing an EC50 in a comparable range [9] . A recently published comparison study of their in vitro activity demonstrated higher potency of hydroxychloroquine over chloroquine, with EC50 values similar to prior data [10] . The authors utilized physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation techniques and provided a rationale for the optimal dosing regimen for hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily) based on their in silico experiment.',\n",

The efficacy of these drugs is in a 20-70% range (Gonçalves et al., 2020) . Thus, drugs at the high end of this interval could successfully be used in a prophylactic regime. More precise estimates of R 0 and N will be available soon. The drug efficacy needed to block infection with these refined parameter estimates can be calculated with our online interactive tool, provided that viral within-host dynamics are correctly described by the model in (1). To the best of our current knowledge, prophylactic antiviral therapy can block (or at least delay) a viral infection, could be administered to people at risk such as health care workers, and alleviate the burden on the healthcare systems caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.',\n",

The 'BTKi-cont' cohort had particularly prompt recoveries. Apart from hydroxychloroquine, neither received other therapies that could have contributed to their favourable outcomes. Recognising the limitations of a small sample size, our present findings support those of Treon et al. 5 , suggesting that BTKi may indeed have protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 virulence.\",\n",

The paper by Gautret et al. raised a lot of attention and contributed to a demand for the drug without the appropriate evidence of its benefit. The study by Gautret et al. showed important methodological issues and does not provide a suggestion of effectiveness. A lack of COVID-19 study subjects and a strong motivation to find a treatment is not an issue, but good quality studies are needed. The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy provided an official statement on the paper in their journal that it did not meet their standard [54] .

Also recently, WHO halted hydroxychloroquine trial over safety concerns [34, 35] . This manuscript helps healthcare professionals understand the potentials for drug interactions between AEDs and therapies suggested and used in COVID-19. Drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions of AEDs and anti-COVID-19 therapies could pose significant therapeutic challenges. While not all potential drugdrug interactions are clinically significant, some may represent a tremendous threat to the well-being of patients and should be considered seriously in the management process of critically ill patients. In addition, cardiac, hepatic, or renal impairments in patients with COVID-19 may require adjustment to AEDs. Therapeutic drug monitoring and also close monitoring of the patient's clinical status is necessary when PWE contract COVID-19 and need to receive treatment. We should emphasize that covering all drugs used in the treatment of patients with epilepsy was beyond the scope of this review. For example, while steroids and everolimus are not conventional AEDs, they may be used in the treatment of some epilepsy syndromes, such as autoimmune epilepsies and tuberous sclerosis complex. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infections and may reduce resistance to new infections [36] . Furthermore, corticosteroids may exacerbate infections and increase the risk of disseminated infections [36] . Similarly, everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Furthermore, everolimus may cause non-infectious pneumonitis (presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, cough, and dyspnea) [37] . Therefore, it is important to consider any and all adverse effects and drug interactions in patients with epilepsy, who become infected with SARS-CoV2 and need treatment for COVID-19.\",\n",
       " 'Similarly, the use of HCQ, alone or combined with azithromycin, has diminished markedly due to safety concerns and questionable efficacy. 17, 18 Though less than 20% of patients in our study were receiving COVID-19 drug therapy, the most commonly used drug was HCQ. Recently, results of a multinational registry analysis of over 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ (n=3016), HCQ + macrolide (n=6221), chloroquine (n=1868), or chloroquine + macrolide (n=3783) were reported. 18 The investigators observed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and de-novo ventricular arrhythmias with HCQ or chloroquine-based therapy, though these results have been called into question more recently. 19 Subsequently, the World Health Organization paused enrollment for a clinical trial of HCQ, and the fate of HCQ as a COVID-19 therapy is currently uncertain. 20 Whereas the agents above have known limitations, other agents including IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab), IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab), and remdesivir are gaining increased attention. The IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, appeared beneficial in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 based upon improvements in oxygen requirements, fever resolution, lung imaging, and inflammatory markers. 21 Preliminary data from randomized, placebo-controlled, trial of sarilumab showed clinical improvements in patients with critical COVID-19. 22 However, these treatments are not without risks as agents targeting the cytokine response may increase the risk for secondary infections, gastrointestinal perforations, and hepatic toxicity. 23 Comprehensive information regarding the safety of these as yet unproven agents is needed as their use becomes more common in patients with COVID-19.',\n",

       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that have shown in vitro activity on the replication of certain coronaviruses. In the context of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments. The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of Page 2 of 17 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease. Meanwhile, serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, justifying to limit its prescription, and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.',\n",
       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to have activity on the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus in vitro, with possibly superior effect for hydroxychloroquine, which is currently at the center of attention.',\n",
       " 'However, mid-May 2020, available clinical data do not support any efficacy of these drugs in patients with COVID-19. Good quality randomized, controlled trials are still underway. It is essential to be able to include patients in these trials rapidly, in order to have reliable data on whether these drugs are truly effective against COVID-19. Yet, the chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than a hundred studies, with the risk of wasting resources and delaying rigorous trials. Pending their results, the lack of evidence of a possible benefit must be weighed against the known ADRs of hydroxychloroquine, which may be magnified in COVID-19 patients. Although relatively safe at a therapeutic dose and for a short period of time, this drug has a narrow therapeutic index, which requires regular cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring. Serious adverse reactions of hydroxychloroquine have already been reported in patients with COVID-19, especially when it is combined with azithromycin.',\n",
       " \"These results are important in light of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 because each CAD we tested is already FDA approved. One of the CADs we screened, amiodarone, has shown efficacy in vitro against SARS-CoV-1 (55) . Another CAD we screened, verapamil, was recently identified by Gordon et al. using proteomics analysis as possibly being relevant to SARS-CoV-2 (56) (not yet peer reviewed). This suggests amongst the drugs Gordon et al. discovered, verapamil might potentially be prioritized for further pre-clinical investigation. Lastly, azithromycin has shown promise in combination with chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 (57) . This is interesting considering azithromycin's pKa (8.5) and cLogP (2.6) and ability to promote phospholipidosis in vivo (58) , which suggests it might also be acting as a CAD in this context. Some COVID-19 patients are responding well to chloroquine whereas others are not. As the pandemic continues it will be important to better understand who responds to treatment. We established that genome-wide screening in cells can identify key genetic determinants that predict bad outcomes from taking bisphosphonates (1). A similar cellular analysis with SARS-CoV-2 treatments should be considered as soon as there are clear frontrunners.\",\n",
       " \"There are several potential reasons related to membrane biology that may explain why CADs and sphingolipids are particularly important in host responses to pathogens: 1) Sphingolipids are a key part of lipid rafts (63) , which are a common point of entry for many pathogens (64) . For example, SARS-CoV-1 requires sphingolipids in lipid rafts for binding to ACE2 (65); 2) Once inside the cell, pathogens are also susceptible to the unique chemical properties of sphingolipids and CADs. For example, ceramides are non-swelling amphiphiles implying that they cannot give rise to micelles or other aggregates (66) . Though understudied, this would seem to modulate the membranes of inclusion bodies, which are used by many pathogens to evade their destruction (67) . Also, some pathogens need the ER to make more of themselves (68) . Considering CADs associate with membranes (69) potentially in the ER, this could explain why CADs are effective against these types of pathogens; 3) CADs potentiate the effects of many anti-pathogen drugs. For example, zinc is an anti-viral when used in combination therapies (70) . The internalization of zinc ions is largely limited by their incompatibility with the cell membrane chemistry. Chloroquine is a zinc ionophore which increases zinc's uptake by cells thereby promoting its biological effects (71) .\",\n",
       " \"There are several limitations from our analysis: 1) Like chloroquine, myriocin is an immunosuppressant (72) . This suggests if myriocin eventually becomes considered as a treatment against pathogens, it might make a patient's situation worse. Consistent with this, in preclinical studies myriocin has been shown to promote host infection by herpes simplex (73) and dengue viruses (74); 2) We only compared genome-wide mutagenesis screens where cell fitness had been used as the phenotype. We acknowledge reporter-based screens can yield important information we might be missing. However, we used cell fitness because it is robust, and more importantly, because it enabled us to make apples-to-apples comparisons between screens. This is critical for comparing screens using different mutagenesis strategies (CRISPR, CRISPRi, haploid, RNAi) and different types of perturbations (small molecules and pathogens) as we've done here; 3) Our results suggest CADs inhibit SPT thereby inhibiting sphingolipid biosynthesis and ceramide production. Previous studies with antidepressants demonstrated that CADs act on sphingolipid catabolism, in particular on acid sphingomyelinase (24) , which also generates ceramide. We cannot rule out that CADs decrease ceramide levels both at the level of anabolic and catabolism processes. However, our screens strongly suggest the former.\",\n",
       " 'Prions are a type of pathogen we did not include in our analysis because a genome-wide screen in human cells has not yet been done with one. Considering prions or other misfolded pathogenic proteins such as amyloid and tau also engage autophagy (75), we hypothesize sphingolipid biosynthesis and the COG and GARP complexes would also score strongly in a genome-wide screen with such proteins. There is growing evidence that infectious agents might be an important causative factor in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) (76) . Infectious agents and misfolded proteins are both by definition, pathogens. In the future, it will be interesting to assess CADs for their effects on the interrelations of both types of pathogens in the development of AD or other neurodegenerative conditions. Figure 1 : Genome-wide screens in human cells reveals inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase as a potential mechanism of action for diverse CADs.

CADs have relatively high partition coefficients (cLogP) and acid dissociation constants (pKa). A cLogP of ~4-5 is relatively hydrophobic. A pKa value of ~9-10 is weakly basic.

Data on the radiographic findings were reported in the journal Radiology and indicate that COVID-19 pneumonia presents as bilateral ground glass opacities followed by increased consolidations without cavitation or effusion that can lead to ARDS and death. 12 The pathological findings from one autopsy were published in the Lancet. 13 The main feature is that of diffuse alveolar damage, interstitial mononuclear/ lymphocytic infiltrates and hyaline membrane formation. Perhaps of concern for patients with SLE, lymphopaenia (which is common in lupus as one of the criteria for the disease itself and/or medications used to treat) is associated with disease severity and mortality. 8 Per the CDC, treatment options for COVID-19 are currently infection control measures and supportive management of complications. The CDC recommends generally avoiding corticosteroids due to its possible prolonging of viral replication. Remdesivir (an investigational antiviral drug) and chloroquine (an antimalarial drug frequently used in the treatment of SLE), demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19. 14 A clinical trial is underway in China for the use of remdesivir in COVID-19. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration approved a National Institutes of Health adaptive randomised controlled clinical trial of investigational therapeutics (the first investigational drug being remdesivir) for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. 4 Recently, the American College of Rheumatology suggested that patients should 'talk to their rheumatologist or rheumatology professional prior to discontinuing any medications… providers should follow their current practice for interrupting therapy during episodes of infection'. 15 However, there are currently no official guidelines on holding immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases at risk for contracting COVID-19. For outpatients with known contact, who are under quarantine and for certain patients who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and are under investigation for the disease, it may be prudent to hold maintenance immunosuppression for 2 weeks following contact or travel. Patients with autoimmune diseases without clear evidence of exposure should continue their treatments. As always, this should be based on a conversation (including a basic evaluation of COVID-19 risk factors and a risk/benefit analysis) between the patient and the rheumatologist and should be a joint decision. Basic measures to minimise exposure should be reviewed with our patients and include cancelling non-essential travel, avoiding gatherings, reducing contact with others, skipping hugs and handshakes and frequent hand hygiene. Patients complaining of fever and cough should be advised not to come for their appointments and might have to be turned away since they risk infecting others. However, patients with fever, cough and shortness of breath should be directed to the emergency room, where they can be tested, evaluated and treated. Many hospitals are encouraging or mandating telemedicine visits; this may soon extend to everyone.\",\n",
       " 'We generally consider hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine as being effective in lupus, in part due to inhibition of type I interferon (considered our innate first-line defence antiviral response), which has often raised concern about susceptibility to viral infection. However, data are accumulating at a very rapid rate that there may be a paradox. By raising endosomal pH (one of the mechanisms that leads to decreased toll like receptor (TLR) ligation and decreased IFN) COVID-19 viral replication itself is decreased. 16 Since acidification is crucial for endosome maturation and function, Liu and colleagues 17 suggest that endosome maturation could be blocked at intermediate stages of endocytosis, which would then result in decreased transport of virions to the ultimate releasing site. A study by Gao et al 18 suggests that chloroquine has efficacy against the associated pneumonia in multicentre clinical trials conducted in China. Additionally, there have been two other small trials that raise more questions than provide definitive answers to the question of hydroxychloroquine efficacy in COVID-19. 19 20 Specifically, the study by Gautret et al was a single-arm protocol in which 20 confirmed COVID-19 patients were given 600 mg of HCQ daily (and is some cases azithromycin), and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested. Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and 8 had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. A significant reduction of viral carriage was reported. Of note, levels of HCQ were in accord or lower than those seen in our lupus patients prescribed 5 mg/kg. The heterogeneity of the patients included, selection of the control population, high rate of lost to follow-up and handling of missing observations raise concerns about their conclusions. 19 The other trial, a 30-patient, placebo-controlled study of HCQ in patients with relatively mild COVID-19 infections, using 400 mg of HCQ daily, did not show any differences between drug and placebo groups in viral clearance, duration of hospitalisation or radiological progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. 20 Regardless, this is an excellent time to reinforce compliance with hydroxychloroquine in SLE.',\n",
       " 'In a paper from 2017, Channappanavar et al 21 describe a pathogenic cascade that leads to ARDS and death; this Letter mechanism is likely operative in COVID-19 infections. These authors propose a scenario in which viral replication leads to a delayed interferon response, accumulation and activation of monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils, which in aggregate result in an exaggerated immune response responsible for the alveolar and endothelial apoptosis. There is certainly a complexity in the contribution of type I IFNs with regard to early and late responses. The former may restrict virus replication through induction of interferon-stimulated genes, while the latter can exacerbate disease by enhancing recruitment and function of macrophages and other innate immune cell. 21 Dysregulation of inflammatory responses initiates pulmonary damage that leads to ARDS. Data from China suggest that using immunomodulatory therapies like chloroquine, 17 tocilizumab 22 (preferred right now because of the track record) and baricitinib 23 can quench the cytokine storm that ensues in patients with very severe COVID-19 pneumonia. 24 Patients admitted for severe COVID-19 infections should probably hold maintenance therapies; these decisions are best left to the rheumatology/infectious disease teams taking care of them. Rheumatologists and infectious disease specialists should be working together in this epidemic as clear data are not available, thus making recommendations speculative.',\n",

A nonrandomized study by Gautret et al. of 36 patients who did or did not receive HCQ suggested earlier virologic clearance in the HCQ group [8] .

       " \"We hypothesized that patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) would have increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, assessed their psychological symptoms and changes in their routine. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in three groups of participants: (1.) patients with RD, (2.) hospital workers, and (3.) high-school teachers/academic staff. Psychiatric status was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale. Overall response rate was 34.7%. We studied 771 patients with RD, 535 hospital workers, and 917 teachers/academic staff. Most of the patients with RD were unwilling to go to the hospital (86%), while 22% discontinued their medications. Biological DMARDS were the most frequent drugs whose doses were altered. Only 4% were willing to take hydroxychloroquine for protection. Moreover, the frequency of anxiety (20%), depression (43%), and post-traumatic stress (28%) among patients with RD were found to be comparable to that found among the teachers/ academic staff (23%, 43% and 29%, respectively), whereas significantly less than that observed among the hospital workers (40%, 62%, and 46%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Female gender, use of social media, having a comorbid disease, or a psychiatric disorder were found to be independently associated with psychiatric symptoms in total study population. The majority of the patients were unwilling to attend outpatient visits and one-fifth skipped or stopped their immunosuppressive agents. Psychiatric symptoms in patient's and teacher's populations were of considerable clinical concern, despite being significantly lower than that observed among the hospital workers.\",\n",
       " \"This cross-sectional web-based survey done in a large population during the first month of COVID-19 outbreak revealed rather important findings. Faced with an unprecedented situation, patients with RD tried to adapt expectedly by changing their routine: 85.6% were unwilling to attend outpatient visits, 88.2% complied strictly with the restrictions, and 22.4% discontinued or stopped their medications. They seemed to be satisfied with the medical support/information and were unwilling to use 'hydroxychloroquine' which became increasingly attractive during the COVID-19 outbreak [7] . The frequency of the psychological symptoms among patients with RD was similar to that found among teachers/academic staff, whereas significantly lower than that observed among the hospital workers. Nevertheless, anxiety, depression, and PTS levels defined as above the severity threshold for clinical concern were not infrequent in patient's and teacher's population. Significant anxiety was reported by one-fifth, significant depressive symptoms by a nearly half and PTS by one-third of the patients. The same holds true for the sleep problems, for which more than 20% in the sample reported at least severe or very severe degree of trouble. These findings indicate a significant traumatic impact of COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures over psychological well-being of individuals in a deeply affected city. Additionally, being female, having a lower level of education, having a child, living in a crowded family, using social media/TV for ≥ 1 h, having been diagnosed with COVID-19 (participant itself or family relative/close friend), having a comorbid disease or a previous psychiatric diagnosis were found to be independent risk factors associated with the increased PTS, anxiety and depression in our total study population, in line with the previous reports [6, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . These findings essentially emphasize a higher risk for certain individuals for psychological distress during the pandemic, based on their pre-trauma features such as gender, education and psychiatric or medical history, as well as features such as trauma directness, personal victimization of the individual and close relatives and the amount of exposure through TV and social media. Of concern, the latter two can become particularly fertile grounds for anxiety-provoking information and disinformation during a pandemic.\",\n",
       " \"We observed that patients with SpA and BS were less likely to comply strictly to 'stay home' restrictions and more likely to go out for work, most probably due to the male predominance and relatively younger age. Additionally, it was not surprising to see that SpA subgroup which is usually treated with anti-TNF agents was the only subgroup in which regular drug use had been considerably disrupted. Biological DMARDs were by far the most frequent drugs which patients skipped or stopped completely. Another important finding of the study is that patients in the great majority quite possibly consider low-dose prednisolone and many of the non-biological DMARDs 'safe' since the discontinuation rate was only < 10% for each of the drug. It has to be noted that of the regular users of hydroxychloroquine, 10.6% who skipped or stopped it reported that their action was due to the shortage of the drug or failure of prescription renewal. On the other hand, of those who were non-users of hydroxychloroquine, very few (< 5%) were interested in taking it for protective measures, thinking probably that it was unsafe.\",\n",

QTc prolongation, defined as a QTc interval above 500 ms or an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline, was seen in a considerable number of patients (16%), even resulting in ventricular tachycardia in one patient.',\n",
       " 'The QTc interval seemed to increase continuously after initiation of therapy. This could possibly be explained by the apparent half-life of 1.6 days [12] . Due to this half-life, the plasma concentration will further increase during the 5 days of treatment and steady state would only be reached 7 days after starting therapy. This is supported by the concentration-time profile of chloroquine, where the cumulative dose of chloroquine is highest at the end of the treatment period [12] . Thus, QTc prolongation and the associated risk of TdP will continue to increase up until the end of the 5-day treatment period.',\n",
       " 'A study in healthy volunteers showed the QTc prolongation to be greatest 4 h after the second dose of chloroquine [7] . However, this was not demonstrated in our study. On the contrary, the QTc prolongation was similar throughout the second dosing interval. Therefore, the timing of an ECG recording within the dosing interval seems irrelevant for chloroquine.',\n",
       " 'The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine Furthermore, this study demonstrates that 19 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or had their dose adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. In our study, electronically measured QTc values might differ from the manually performed measurement due to differences in standard lead selection, U-wave recognition, U wave inclusion or exclusion, and definition of T-wave ending [11, 13] . Another study found only a minor difference between the computerised and manual interpretation of the QTc interval [9] . However, the reliability of the computerised measurement of the QTc interval has been found to be questionable and manual measurement of the QTc interval is recommended [11, 13, 14] . Based on the present study, it is recommended that a cardiologist is consulted before clinical decisions are made based on the computerised interpretation.',\n",

At admission, glycemia was 6.3 6 0.66 mmol/L in patients with normoglycemia and 11.04 6 1.22 mmol/L in those with hyperglycemia. Eight (23.5%) patients with normoglycemia and 18 (72%) with hyperglycemia had a diagnosis of diabetes before hospitalization. There were no differences in the mean age, sex, BMI, sex distribution, smoking habits, levels of plasma cholesterol, and triglycerides among the groups. The use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, statins, and calcium channel blocker therapy was similar in all study groups (Table 1) . b-Blocker use was almost twice as frequent in patients with hyperglycemia compared with those with normoglycemia, and the use of angiotensin receptor blockers tended to be greater in those with an elevated glucose (Table 1) . Among patients with a diagnosis of diabetes before hospitalization, there were no differences in antidiabetic drugs being taken (eg, insulin, oral drugs) when they were categorized as hyperglycemic and normoglycemic ( Table 1 ). The median time from illness onset (before admission) to discharge or death was 18 days (IQR [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] in patients with hyperglycemia and 16 days (IQR [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] in patients with normoglycemia.

Moreover, both IL-6 and D-dimer levels were correlated with admission blood glucose levels (Fig. 2) . All patients had interstitial lung abnormalities on chest CT scans once admitted. In all patients, the typical findings of chest CT images of COVID-19 on admission showed bilateral ground glass opacity without subsegmental areas of consolidation or mass shadows. Subsequent chest CT images (7 days later) revealed that pneumonia disease progressed with subsegmental areas of consolidation and with mass shadows of high density in both lungs in 10 (40%) patients with hyperglycemia and 3 (8.8%) with normoglycemia (P , 0.01). The composite end point occurred in 13 (52%) patients with hyperglycemia and 5 (14.7%) with normoglycemia (P , 0.01). Further details regarding the individual components are provided in Supplementary Table 1. In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with diabetes and patients with hyperglycemia had a higher risk of severe disease than patients without diabetes and normoglycemia (Fig. 3) .

The treatment for our patients was largely supportive, except a few received Ribavirin or Chloroquine, while absorption of the lesions on chest CT images could be observed in 57.9% of patients on day 8 after onset, along with a remarkable increase in lymphocyte count in the survivors. Pan and coworkers reported 21 cases with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the greatest lung involvement was achieved on day 10 after symptom onset, and the lesions gradually absorbed after 2 weeks. 26 Of note, an obvious discrepancy between symptom and the degree of hypoxemia was found in a considerable number of our patients, 94 of 117 patients (80.3%) had a PaO 2 /FiO 2 of less than 300 mm Hg on admission, but they did not present obvious dyspnea or tachycardia at rest, and the extent of lung involvement on their chest CT image was not always consistent with the degree of hypoxemia.

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo. Precautionary measures should be taken when using these drugs to treat Due to the lack of large clinical trials and small numbers of RCTs, we decided to include all the RCTs reporting adverse events (AEs) in patients with different disease conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, infectious diseases such as HIV infection, and immune diseases such as Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.

According to the in vitro cell test, the antiviral effect of Western drugs is obviously superior to that of traditional Chinese medicine (the concentration value of the inhibitory effect is low). But considering that Chinese herbs have both antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, it has a certain application prospect in disease prevention and treatment; at present, the combination of Chinese and Western Medicine (Qingfeipaidutang and chloroquine phosphate, abidol, lopinavir/Rito) is considered as a better treatment method by experts, and has been listed in \"Protocol of Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\", but there is still a lack of high-quality evidence, which needs clinical verification.',\n",

       " 'The international outbreak of respiratory illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 began in December 2019 that has affected >0.8 million individuals. Self-limiting respiratory tract involvement, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death are the spectrum of COVID-19. To date, there are no especial therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infections. One such medication includes the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which recently reported as a possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, reducing inf lammatory reactions to infection, impairing the exacerbation of pneumonia and boosting lung imaging findings. Like all medications, HCQ has side effects and may occur in COVID-19 patients. Here, we report on the case of a 42-year-old woman, presented with fever and dry cough, who had COVID-19 and 2 days later presented with a pruritic erythematous maculopapular rash, which started from the distal of upper extremities and rapidly, involved the entire body.',\n",
       " \"COVID-19 is an emerging disease that currently has no specific treatment, and the treatments are purely supportive. Chloroquine and its derivatives, such as HCQ, have a long history of being used as prophylactic drugs in malaria areas. In some studies, HCQ has been used to improve the symptoms of patients with COVID-19. This drug is used to support patients with COVID-19 and is not known as a definitive treatment for the disease [3, 4] . The mechanism of action of HCQ is to affect intracellular components such as endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles and to increase their pH, which interferes with the steps of virus replication, including fusion and uncoating. The side effects of taking this drug occur when it is not sufficiently dispersed through the relatively small central portion. Therefore, the amount of drug entering the central part is an important factor in causing skin reactions [5] . The most common HCQ usage complications are headache, dizziness and gastrointestinal complications. Some studies of COVID-19 patients have reported complications such as gastrointestinal distress, headache, blurred vision, insomnia and prolonged QT interval [3, 6] . In our case, erythema multiforme with maculopapular rash, and flat atypical targets were seen in the distal part of the limb. The skin complications caused by HCQ use are infrequent. These include acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, SJS, toxic epidermal necrolysis and rashes. HCQ is a very rare cause of drug-induced SJS. This condition begins as itchy papular erythematous eruptions in the trunk and then affects the face, organs and mucous membranes of the mouth. It also had purulent rashes on the trunk, limbs and face [7] . In a study by Volpe et al. [8] , a patient with rheumatoid arthritis after taking HCQ developed diffuse, erythematous exfoliative rash involving trunk and limbs, which diagnosed as a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome. In another study, after taking HCQ, the patient developed skin symptoms of SJS such as a pruritic rash over her abdomen, which described as 'targets' with a persisting exfoliating rash and eczematous patches [9] .\",\n",

None of the 17 symptom-only patients had to be hospitalized. The flow of COVID-19 patients during the course disease is shown in Fig. 2 . Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during hospitalization. As of April 24, 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started first-line endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib, and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Noteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling). Further details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Table 4 . An exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission or death in the COVID-19 population showed that among all factors listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3, only age > 70 years and hypertension were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p < 0.05). More specifically, the ongoing systemic treatment type (Supplementary Table 1 ), lymphopenia (< 0.5 G/L), neutropenia (< 1 G/L), and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had no significant prognostic impact (all p value > 0.6). Age and hypertension remained as prognostic factors in the subgroup of RNA test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance.

       " 'The current COVID-19 pandemic urges the immediate therapeutic treatments to protect the health of people who are at high risk of infection, particularly when vaccines are still under development. To date, no specific therapeutic treatment is available, and current treatment includes supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, fluid management, use of approved antiviral drugs developed for Ebola (remdesivir), 36 anti-HIV (lopinavirritonavir), 37 and recently approved antimalaria drugs (hydroxychloroquine) 38 as a combination therapy. The combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was also shown as a partial treatment against COVID-19. 39 In order to develop targeted therapeutics, initially, design of compound libraries based on the available target protein structures and active binding moiety of the protein residues is an important step. Although it is hard to predict the potency and binding specificity from the structure of a chemical compound, structure-based design of novel bioactive scaffolds is considered as an important approach to accomplish adequate chemical diversity of compound libraries that facilitate SAR analysis. Of particular note, finding a potent molecule with drug-like properties remains challenging, and therefore, advanced drug discovery involves CADD approaches that accelerates the early discovery phases. The main protease, 3CL pro , of SARS-CoV-2 was presented as an attractive drug target, and a rapid identification of drug candidates was achieved through virtual screening. 33, 34 Encouraged with this, and exploiting a recently published crystal structure of 3CL pro from SARS-CoV-2 (PDB code 6LU7), 16 we executed virtual screening for the 13 antiviral drugs.

       " 'We present three cases with COVID-19 infection, each with unique cardiac complications ( Table 1) . Emerging evidence suggests a predilection of SARS-CoV-2 for the cardiovascular system, in some cases as prevalent as respiratory involvement. 7, 8 Studies have demonstrated use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein by SARS-CoV-2, and similarly other coronaviruses, for cell entry. 9 ACE2 serves as a lung protectant, explaining pulmonary involvement. Moreover, ACE2 is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, possibly explaining the increased prevalence of renal and cardiac complications. An additional pathophysiological explanation for the extent of cardiovascular involvement stems from the systemic inflammatory effects driven by the virus, predominantly through cytokine release and inflammatory cascade highlighted by serum biomarker elevation. 3 Other highly pathogenic coronavirus strains have shown correlative evidence to have cytokine storms leading to deleterious clinical manifestations. 10 In the first case of this series, we witnessed elevation in inflammatory markers and imaging consistent with pericarditis complicated by pericardial effusion in the setting of COVID-19. Pericardiocentesis fluid analysis was consistent with viral aetiology, and she was optimally managed with drainage and adjuvant hydrocortisone and colchicine, as well as treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine. Approximately 80-90% of pericarditis cases are idiopathic or caused by viruses, which can be further complicated by pericardial effusion. 11 In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been two documented reports of pericardial effusions and one developing cardiac tamponade. 12 A review of 90 COVID-19 patients revealed one with pericardial effusion. 13 Further large-scale investigations into COVID-19-induced pericarditis and the role of the cytokine storm are needed to make definitive recommendations for treatment.',\n",

Our findings are in concordance with previous studies, where hydroxychloroquine showed efficacy in disease outcome. 13, 14 Furthermore, Cao et al. concluded that lopinavir/ritonavir is not efficacious for COVID-19; however, the data was not assessed in relation to individual patient parameters. 15 Our regression model identified age as a determinant in responsiveness to lopinavir/ritonavir, with efficacy being related to younger ages. Age has been identified as an important determinant in the mortality from COVID-19, but we show that younger age is also a determinant in the responsiveness to anti-viral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir. We also used the model to determine the efficacy of a combined azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine regimen and found that the combination was not significant in clinical outcomes. This is contrary to current protocols and a previous study. 16 The second most significant finding was symptom relapse in 40% of patients after discharge. The most common relapsed symptoms were cough (18.6%) and shortness of breath (18.6%). Six patients (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died after discharge. This emphasizes the need for a close follow-up after symptom improvement. Lan et al. showed that certain patients could recover and test negative, only to test positive again. 17, 18 This phenomenon might underlie the symptom rebound in our patients and might indicate that patients are still a source of transmission after recovering from COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'Due to the urgent need to stop the spread of the COVID-19 attempts to find the drug with anti SARS-CoV-2 effects among ones already available on a market are actively being made. A number of in vitro as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown that widely used compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is able to cause anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as treatment and prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity change in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found that most of the patients demonstrated gradual decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the swab regardless of the HCQ receiving. Noteworthy that patients with RNA load higher than 10 6 copies were hospitalized due to condition deteriorating significantly more frequently compared to those with RNA load below 10 6 copies even with HCQ administration. In addition, the results of the current study indicate that recovering patients may produce viruses at least during 18 days from the onset of symptoms and HCQ therapy does not block or reduce it.',\n",

Three patients in our study received hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir [29, 34] ; no distinctive histopathologic changes were observed in the treated patients. While our observations indicate an association between the duration from onset of respiratory failure and SARS-CoV-2 abundance in the lung, many of the clinical features of this infection complicate our understanding of this relationship, including its predilection for infecting individuals with multiple comorbidities and the phenomenon of silent hypoxemia. The apparently low burden of viral protein in three of the five patients with predominantly acute-phase DAD may reflect a relatively long duration of infection prior to death, however this is necessarily speculative. Patient 1 reported 2 weeks of symptoms prior to presentation and therefore likely had begun clearing the infection from the lungs by the time of death, whereas for two patients (cases 2 and 3) with neurologic impairment, the timing of symptom onset was uncertain. Alternatively, individual variation in viral abundance may reflect specific host factors; indeed, patient 4 was profoundly immunocompromised, likely explaining the persistence of viral protein despite relatively longer duration from diagnosis to death. Finally, patient 5 had an intervening acute myocardial infarction, thus we were able to examine her virally infected lungs at an early phase of DAD.',\n",

A significant difference was observed between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls starting even on day3 post-inclusion. These results are of great importance because a recent paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-19 in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19] Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14] . These in vitro results corroborate our clinical results. The target values indicated in this paper [14] were reached in our experiments.

This finding should be further explored to know whether a combination is more effective especially in severe cases. Speculated potential risk of severe QT prolongation induced by the association of the two drugs has not been established yet but should be considered.

Recent data point to the fact that hepatotoxicity is more frequently occurring in severe COVID-19 cases compared with patients with mild disease.

Current drugs prescribed to treat COVID-19 including oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are metabolized in the liver. As a result, frequent and careful monitoring of liver function in patients with COVID-19 can lead to early diagnosis of hepatitis, liver injury, and liver failure.

       " 'The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic that hit the world in 2020 triggered a massive dissemination of information (an \"infodemic\") about the disease that was channeled through the print, broadcast, web, and social media. This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on people\\'s behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this behavior. Finally, we discuss the role of pharmacovigilance stakeholders in emergency management and possible strategies to deal with other similar crises in the future.',\n",

Such terrain was particularly fertile for conspiracy theorists and profiteers. All media are involved in the spreading and amplification of information, and the communication process may have different patterns. Information can be generated in different ways, from the results of small or poorly conceived studies to reports highlighted in newspapers (such as with chloroquine, ibuprofen, or even ACEIs and ARBs), or may start in social media and \"go viral\" in a few hours (such as with antivirals). Among communication materials, short videos appear to be a particularly effective method of spreading information. Whatever the starting point, inadequate, sensational, or distorted information first affects opinion leaders, often politicians, and those active on social media, which, deliberate or not, lends consistency and reliability to the information. The final effect can be inadequate choices made by individuals everywhere.',\n",

The first effect on the behavior of many people was an initial rush to purchase the drug, which depleted stocks and then meant that patients using these drugs for approved indications were denied treatment. This was the case with chloroquine. Another consequence was the probable diffusion of falsified products, for which safety problems cannot be excluded in the face of a definite lack of efficacy. This has affected almost all drugs but particularly antivirals. For instance, although there is no evidence of a relationship with the pandemic, at the beginning of May 2020, authors from Africa reported the discovery of falsified chloroquine [99] . The second effect on the behavior of many people involved drugs being taken without medical supervision. This situation can have three types of consequences: (1) overdose, facilitated by the common belief that \"more is better\"; (2) intake independent from therapeutic rationale (these drugs are often promoted by describing a generic benefit, such as \"the drug is beneficial against the virus\", and individuals cannot distinguish between preventive use in healthy people, post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment of patients with disease); (3) intake of dangerous preparations with names or contents similar to those of promoted drugs, with a consequent risk of poisoning (the patient who died after self-administration of the fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine illustrates this final point [19] ).',\n",

First, governments, health authorities, and manufacturers must collaborate to stimulate and support academia and research institutions in conducting studies to ensure that the risk-benefit profile of drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 is adequate. This includes not only clinical trials but also observational studies, particularly those of real-world evidence, which correlate the trends of drug use with clinical outcomes through evaluation of healthcare databases. In this regard, ethics committees have a key role to play in the proper evaluation of protocols and risk-benefit assessments, which must be tailored to the drugs and their indications (infection prevention, treatment of active disease, off-label use, compassionate use) and to the patients (critically or non-critically ill). Notably, several institutions were very efficient at developing COVID-19-specific guidelines in a few weeks, which were very helpful for caregivers involved in investigations of anti-COVID-19 drugs all over the world [100-102]. The collaboration of these investigators is also essential to ensure quality in data collection and avoid dispersion of information with detrimental effects on study quality [103] . Given the large number of articles being published on this topic in the scientific literature, health authorities should carefully consider the quality of evidence before taking decisions. As such, the retracted article about hydroxychloroquine safety issues [23] represents an important lesson.',\n",
       " 'The course and development of critical illness or ARDS were similar in most cases with the patient\\'s condition deteriorating within 48-72 hours of initial presentation. Most of them developed dyspnea and severe hypoxemia with declining oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) during the second week of illness requiring oxygen supplementation or assisted ventilation. The patient who was diagnosed accidentally at early stages of infection was immediately treated with oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily (BID) and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg stat, based on the Iranian interim guideline for \"clinical management of COVID-19\", though the patient developed fever and dyspnea three days later [9] . Management was switched to a focused antiviral treatment regimen with oseltamivir 75 mg and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg BID and the patient gradually improved attaining normal oxygen saturation without the need of intubation or supplemental oxygen [9] .',\n",

Recently, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir, and remdesivir therapy has been proposed as a potential treatment option (13) . However, the efficacy of all such treatments is largely unknown. A previous study showed that health-care workers with a high risk of exposure to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) who received lopinavir/ritonavir as post-exposure prophylaxis was associated with a 40% decrease in the risk of infection (14). In this context, we initially administrated prophylactic lopinavir/ritonavir to the LT recipient. However, because of the drug interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir, we switched to hydroxychloroquine. In line with this, it is unknown whether prophylactic lopinavir/ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine has any role in preventing the donor-derived transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the recipient. This should be considered an urgent subject for further studies by researchers.',\n",

The pharmacokinetics of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been described to be similar [9] . The very high accumulation of these drugs in lysosomes produces very high local concentrations of both compounds. Furthermore, the uptake of these basic drugs into lysosomes increases the lysosomal pH [22] . However, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude and time course of this alkalization as there is continuous acidification of the lysosomal space by proton pumps that function to maintain low pH.',\n",

       " 'Chloroquine was shown to impair early stages of virus replication by interfering with the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral entry of several different viruses [28] . Due to the alkalization of endosomes, chloroquine was an effective in vitro treatment against Chikungunya virus when added to Vero cells prior to virus exposure. A pH-dependent mechanism of entry of coronavirus into target cells was also reported for SARS-CoV-1 [29] . The activation step that occurs in endosomes at acidic pH results in fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, leading to the release of the viral SARS-CoV-1 genome into the cytosol. In the absence of antiviral drug, the virus is targeted to the lysosomal compartment where the low pH, along with the action of enzymes, disrupts the viral particle, thus liberating the infectious nucleic acid and, in several cases, enzymes necessary for its replication. Hence, the lysosomal space has been proposed as a major target site to tackle SARS-CoV-2 [30] .',\n",
       " 'As with the use of any drug or drug combination, the potential benefit has to be weighed against any safety concerns. Prolongation of QT interval and cases of torsades de pointes have been reported for both drugs [18, 33] . Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and, according to its prescribing information, should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias [33] . There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if the drug is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs [4] . Most relevant interaction data with azithromycin is available for chloroquine. QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily) [18] . Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose-and concentration-dependent manner. Compared with chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively. Furthermore, studies in pigs revealed that azithromycin/chloroquine combinations did not increase cardiac instability [34] . In a clinical interaction study between azithromycin and chloroquine, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic changes were observed [23] .',\n",
       " 'However, increases in QTc values were noted. Although mean increases were numerically greater for the azithromycin plus chloroquine group compared with the chloroquine alone group, these differences were not statistically significant. Administered alone and together, chloroquine and azithromycin were well tolerated overall in this study. More investigations with hydroxychloroquine are needed as well as finetuning the optimum dosing regimen to get a clearer picture of the expected risk-benefit assessment in these severe infections. These dose optimization attempts will have to utilize ways to estimate the respective infection site concentration; this is very challenging due to the tremendous differences in subcellular concentrations. Average tissue concentrations based on lung/blood ratios obtained from animal studies have been proposed and applied but may not be appropriate for dose optimization [35] .',\n",

       " 'The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.',\n",

       " 'At present, there is no evidence showing specific drug treatment against the new coronavirus in suspected or confirmed cases. The principles of treatment include improvement of the symptoms and underlying diseases, active prevention of potential complications, and secondary infections. Like other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis [25] . Studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 may infect alveolar epithelial cells in the lung through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor, which is also expressed in other tissues, such as kidney, blood vessels, and heart [25, 26] . Researchers using an artificial intelligence predicted that Baricitinib, an inhibitor of AP2-associated protein kinase 1, might be useful to interrupt the entrance of virus to cells as well as the intracellular assembly of virus particles [4, 27] . In addition, a case report showed that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, has shown survival benefits in one severely affected patient with COVID-19 pneumonia [28] . The effectiveness has been verified in vitro [29] . Now a couple of clinical trials focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, as well as other therapeutic strategies, such as immunoglobulins, Vitamin C infusion, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, arbidol hydrochloride plus interferon atomization, ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol hydroxychloroquine and methylprednisolone [30] .',\n",
       " 'The possibility that the diffuse use of CQ and HCQ may possibly have a chemoprophylactic role in the populations that have so far been much less affected by the pandemic, e.g., those of most African countries or of India, could not be based on the accurate numerical analyses done for the BCG vaccination. However, although highly circumstantial, it should still be discussed, considering the still very diffuse consumption of CQ by populations in which malaria is still endemic. CQ has been instrumental in controlling the malaria tragedy, particularly its resurgence after the international ban on dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, which had largely eliminated it by exterminating the Anopheles mosquito. Unfortunately, CQ therapy was compromised by the widespread appearance of drug resistance, particularly for Plasmodium falciparum: a threonine at position 76 of the CQ resistance gene pfcrt being the marker for CQ resistence 39 . As a result, following a recommendation of the WHO at the end of last century, most African countries officially discontinued its use in the fight against malaria, replacing it with artemisinin-based therapy. In a short time, however, the cessation of drug pressure led to the re-emergence of CQ-sensitive Plasmodia 40 : in Malawi, the first African country that had discontinued the use of CQ in 1993, by 2003 the mutant pfcrt gene was no longer present and CQ-sensitive malaria had regained predominance, as confirmed by the full efficacy of the drug in a clinical trial 41 . The pattern by which the resistance to CQ emerged and then declined had a strong regional character, with resistance emerging earlier in East Africa with respect to West Africa (see also Fig. 4 ). The pattern reflected the variation in the use of the drug but also reflected the degree of acceptance of the recommended official policy by the different African populations. The accurate analysis by b Visualization of the data in panel A. c The map shows the occurrence of chloroquine resistance in the Plasmodium parasite, from darkblue (resistance at high levels) to light blue (no resistance). Countries in cyan are devoid of any malaria, but in those countries, chloroquine orhydroxychloroquine are still used for some autoimmune or inflammatory condition. Countries, where high chloroquine resistance occurs, are still among thehighest consumers of chloroquine, notwithstanding the adverse recommendation by most health authorities.',\n",

This age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may reduce case fatality rate (CFR) in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.

One possible explanation is that hygiene measures during quarantine and isolation were sufficient to avoid further spread. However, considering the high reproduction number of COVID-19, a false-negative PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and false negative serology have to be considered. For the latter, a weak to mild symptomatology could explain the lack of detectable immune reaction. 20 Finally, negative serological testing might be linked to not yet fully validated technology. 19 How covert shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may be reduced in the future, for example by prophylactic hydroxychloroquine, 21 remains unknown but is of great strategic interest for civil and military authorities.',\n",

The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated. The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved.

For patients admitted to hospitals with severe infections, temporary discontinuation of most DMARDs is recommended to allow RA patients to develop protective immunity and eliminate the pathogens [10] . On the other hand, pausing the administration of DMARDs might provoke an inflammatory exacerbation of RA, which usually is managed by increased doses of immunosuppressive medications. The effect of steroid use in COVID-19 is still unknown. Steroid might worsen the infections by reducing the immune system, but the inflammatory cascade of pneumonia could be blocked by the administration of systemic steroid treatment [11] . Previous reports demonstrated that the steroid treatment was related with higher mortality of patients with a viral infection such as influenza pneumonia [12] and that steroid use was associated with delayed coronavirus RNA clearance of both Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [13] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [14] . In the presented cases, while we discontinued leflunomide and steroids to minimize the severity of COVID-19, we continued the administration of hydroxychloroquine due to its possible antiviral effects [15] , as well as its antirheumatic effects.',\n",

Evidence has shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can transmit the disease to others.

       " 'SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly since it first emerged in December, 2019, and COVID-19 is characterised as a pandemic by WHO. As a new emerging virus, there is no approved effective drug or vaccine. As of April 16, 2020, several existing drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, with dozens of ongoing clinical trials assessing their potential efficacy. DMARDs, due to their immune-modu lat ing nature, could be a potential treatment option for severe COVID-19. However, there are several issues that need to be taken into considera tion. First, the issue of hyperinflamma tion versus viral replication. Although effective anti-viral immunity is required for the clearance of pathogens, hyperactivation of immune response causes tissue damage and organ failure. Similarly, there are two sides of immunomodulation therapy in COVID-19, and clinicians should determine in which circumstance to use such medications. Second, there are questions about the timing for immunomodulation therapy. As noted, immuno suppressants could affect anti-viral immune response and the timing should be carefully considered. Although early intervention is considered as a key factor for the success of immuno modulation therapy in infection-associated hyper inflam mation, 103 direct evidence from RCTs are required to determine the appropriate timing for patients with COVID-19. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of oral medi cations in crucially ill patients merit considera tion, as physiological altera tions in these patients can sub stantially affect the pharmacokinetics. Some drugs will need to be given parenterally due to gastrointestinal failure (eg, chloroquine has been used parenterally to treat severely ill patients with malaria, although it is absorbed reliably in these patients). 104 Compared with the oral route, parenteral administration of chloroquine results in rapid absorption and transient high plasma concentrations, which is associated with increased risk of acute toxicity. 105 In addition, impaired clearance of the drugs might be problematic in patients with hepatic dysfunction and renal failure. Therefore, smaller and more frequent doses, continuous intravenous infusion, or choosing a less toxic drug (eg, using hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine) should be con sidered in patients who are severely ill. 104, 105 The many ongoing trials will hopefully provide a better understanding of the potential effects of immunomodulation therapy on COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation.',\n",

In this study, we give three suggestions for DCTs as follows. Firstly, drugs in CPIC guideline including ribavirin, α -interferon, chloroquine and captopril should be utilized with genetic detections as guided. In this situation, adequate gene detection kits should be prepared in Africa for COVID-19 therapy, as related genetic variation frequency is higher in AFRs than other countries. Secondly, drug such as chloroquine whose efficacy and toxicity can be determined by nonsynonymous mutations, may be preferred in special population with lower frequency of risk alleles such as Finnish and Non-Finnish European.

       " 'In our analysis approach, treatment with CTLA4-Ig showed a regulation at the transcriptional level that is highly antagonistic to that induced by COVID-19. We have shown this by two complementary strategies. In the first strategy we have found that, from the most well-established pathological processes associated with COVID-19 to date, abatacept induces a transcriptional change that is contrary to the one induced by the virus in most of them. In a first group of processes related to innate immune system detection of SARS-CoV2 we found that treatment with abatacept downregulates TLRsignaling pathway and endosomal transport. TLRs are key to detect the presence of the virus, leading to the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors and the expression of IFN and other cytokines(46). While viral detection is essential to trigger the immune response in the first stages of the infection, later its utility might be superseded by the need to adequately control excessive inflammatory response (5) . To this regard, our analysis did not detect a strong type I IFN inhibition, thereby suggesting that this basic anti-viral mechanism is protected. Of interest, we found a significant downregulation of endosomal transport, a biological process that has been linked to the possible protective of hydroxychloroquine in . A reduction endosomal development and maturation would keep at stake viral load. However, the confirmation of this mechanism in relation to SARS-CoV2 infection and the clinical protection are still controversial and are in need of robust evidence (47).',\n",

Preliminary studies to date featuring hydroxychloroquine in combination with adjunctive agents for severe COVID-19 report it does not appear effective and may even be harmful. 5 Indeed, off-label hydroxychloroquine prescribing is expected to contribute to supply chain shortages for approved chronic use during the pandemic. 2 Furthermore, the issuance of the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine, which permits distribution of the drug from the national stockpile for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was widely misinterpreted as an FDA approval for this indication. 4 This study suggests that Presidential endorsements can influence prescription practices, even in the absence of high-quality evidence or US FDA approval for the given indication.

ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'The unmet need for effective treatments for COVID-19 has spurred pharmaceutical companies to develop or repurpose therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Frontline providers may be unfamiliar with the usage of older therapeutics, such as chloroquine, or medicines typically used by subspecialists, like DNA vaccines, protease inhibitors, or convalescent plasma therapy. In conjunction with effective infection control policies, a combination of measured and reasoned repurposing of existing therapies, development and vetting of novel drugs, and guidance by medical toxicologists may reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and avoid cases where the cure is worse than the disease.',\n",
       " \"In conclusion, a better identification of susceptible individuals (particularly with smoking and vaping histories) and their early detection, as well as targeting ACE2 receptor (and isoforms), surface proteases, and other immunological/inflammatory targets could be a major game changer in managing the spread of this pandemic and further infections. Although many questions still remain unanswered which need to be considered for future research. Considering that many smokers/exsmokers with airway obstructions show steroid resistance (e.g., severe asthmatics and patients with COPD), the use of steroids for management of COVID-19 must be reconsidered. It is not clear if the disease severity arises due to excessive production of pro-inflammatory responses or reduction in anti-inflammatory mediators (proresolving mediators), affecting alveolar inflammation, and due to secretory associated senescence phenotype (SASP) in aging lungs. Senesced cells may harbor components of RNA or RNA virus may hijack the host cells, and release exosomes/extracellular vesicles containing pro-inflammatory miRNA and/or viral genome/ spike protein/ACE2 receptor. Careful examination of the macrophage responses on COVID-19 infection with the assessment of the phenotypic switching might be of interest in future. Further studies are required to determine the contribution of NETs in alveolar inflammation, role of epithelial permeability, and proteases in SARS- Fig. 2 Potential drug targets and strategies being tested to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV2 has a high binding affinity to ACE2 receptors found in abundance in the type II pneumocytes in the lung alveolar epithelium. This could be targeted by ACE inhibitors/ARBs. On binding to the ACE2 receptors, TMPRSS2 protease cleaves the viral S protein and enable the engulfment of the viral body into the cell. Here the viral proteases enable the fusion of the endosomal membrane and release of viral RNA (genome) into the host's cytoplasm. TMPRSS2 inhibitors or antimalarial drugs (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) can prevent this engulfment. The viral RNA now hijacks the host's translational machinery to express viral proteins and further enables viral replication and packaging. This is the site of action for various antiviral drugs being tested in clinical trials at present. The viral RNA and protein get packaged as virions which are ultimately released into the extracellular space, where it leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and infiltration of immune cells. It is speculated that the heightened immune response is responsible for the disease severity in COVID-19 patients, thus immune-modulation is one of the alternate to be used to prevent serious outcomes. Alternate approaches like targeting viral structural targets or use of convalescent plasma to induce passive immunity are other strategies which are being explored at present Cov2 epithelial entry. Also, the health implications of this infection amongst the recovered population remains unknown (e.g. will they develop more recurrent infections and lung remodeling/impaired repair leading to pulmonary fibrosis over a period of time). Given the ACE2 polymorphism, the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in governing the disease susceptibility (particularly in patients with hypertension) is yet another consideration to guide future research. Overall, understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection with subsequent pneumonia with lung cytokine storms, and identifying the emerging therapeutic strategies will provide timely treatment of this devastating disease. \",\n",
       " 'An intriguing result observed in this study was that remdesivir slightly enhanced EV71 replication at low concentrations (0.01 ∼ 0.1 µM). Moreover, this effect is likely related to remdesivir pretreatment, which may affect subsequent viral entry steps. Additionally, remdesivir was found to enhance SARS-CoV-2 entry compared to chloroquine slightly. The mechanism by which remdesivir enhances virus replication after pretreatment needs further investigation. However, this study suggests the possibility that combining remdesivir with other virus entry inhibitors, e.g., neutralizing antibody or nafamostat, may be efficient for the treatment of viral diseases by compensating for the virus replication enhancing effects of remdesivir. Also, these findings should be taken into account when considering the remdesivir research during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.',\n",

These investigations are in progress but it requires months to years to develop the vaccines for COVID-19. So far, the infected virus patient's population is growing rapidly.

SARS-CoV-19 is a betacoronavirus, as are SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronoviridae. Drugs such as lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, chloroquine, and corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, with controversial efficacy. The proteinase inhibitor lopinavir inhibits SARS coronavirus, and ritonavir inhibits metabolism of lopinavir, thus increasing its concentration [3] . The combination lopinavir/ritonavir is speculated as a possible therapy for COVID-19, as it has demonstrated some efficacy as a treatment for SARS. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have demonstrated in-vitro efficacy against COVID-19 by an as yet not fully understood mechanism [4, 5] . Hydroxychloroquine might be preferred as it has fewer side effects than chloroquine, but have neither have yet demonstrated efficacy in infected patients. Similarly, remdesivir is a potent inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from MERS, and has also demonstrated in-vitro efficacy against COVID-19 [6, 7] . Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 inhibitor with a fairly good safety profile is being studied in China for treatment of COVID-19 [8] .

In addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] .

Fig. 3 plots the binding affinities of these compounds, along with those of a few previously reported inhibitors such as remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Considering hydroxychloroquine as a reference, we note that the inhibition potentials of the extracts of harsingar, aloe vera and giloy are very encouraging. The extracts of turmeric, neem, ashwagandha and ginger have larger inhibition potentials than that of chloroquine. The compounds extracted from other plants also possess certain inhibition properties against COVID-19 protease.',\n",

The inhibition potentials of all these plant extracts are found to be larger than those of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These two anti-malarial drug compounds are already reported to inhibit COVID-19 protease in vitro. Due to inherent toxicity and side-effects, however, they are not approved by most of the countries. Therefore, our findings become very interesting towards the development of alternative (herbal) medicines having no apparent sideeffects. We expect prompt actions in this direction to combat with the COVID-19.',\n",

       " 'Hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir are the only two drugs that have received emergency use authorizations from the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. 3,10 Given the longer development, testing, and approval times for novel chemical entities, repurposing drugs already approved for other indications is a promising approach to rapidly identify an effective therapy.',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine is at the forefront of repurposing drug candidates. Although ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies are expected to provide more informative evidence about hydroxychloroquine in the near future, the outcomes observed in our retrospective study provide substantial information about the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin from the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. Specifically, we found that hydroxychloroquine use with or without co-administration of azithromycin did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.',\n",
       " 'Subsequent to the release of preliminary data from our study on April 21, 2020, 11 two different groups from New York confirmed our findings in larger cohorts. 12, 13 The findings of our study are similar to the observational study from a New York hospital which reported no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment on respiratory failure or mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 12 However, that study did not report on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine when co-administered with azithromycin. In addition, we present the hazards of mortality and use of ventilation separately unlike that study, which considered both these outcomes as a composite measure. Given the number of clinical trials currently testing the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19 and the potential synergistic toxicity of these drugs, 4, 8 it is important to gather insights into the outcomes of patients treated with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The results of our study are also similar to another recent study from 25 New York hospitals, which reported that use of hydroxychloroquine, with and without azithromycin, was not associated with reduced mortality but did not report on the risk of mechanical ventilation. 13 That study found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had a higher risk of cardiac arrest. Recently a large multinational registry analysis study demonstrated an increased risk in mortality and ventricular arrythmias in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without macrolides. 14 Although that study reported an absence of difference in baseline characteristics among the groups, it considered only two measures of disease severity and did not correct for many relevant laboratory variables. The results of our nationwide study not only confirm findings from both regional studies from New York but, in addition, after propensity score adjustment based on multiple variables, showed comparable mortality and mechanical ventilation rates to the multinational study. In addition to these retrospective observational studies, a recent randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for mild to moderate COVID-19 did not observe any beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment. 15 The overall mortality rate -19.3% of the patients with known outcomes of death/discharge by April 29, 2020 -in our study was lower compared to large descriptive studies from China (28%) 16 and Italy (26%) 17 and similar to a large case series reported from New York City (21%). 18 The multinational study reported a mortality rate of 9.3% in the control group and a range of 16.4% to 23.8% in all groups with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without macrolides. 14 Despite the increased baseline disease severity in HC and HC+AZ groups, the vast majority of them survived (78.9%). It also bears noting that patients with increased baseline disease severity (low oxygen saturation, high systolic blood pressure, elevated D-dimers, lymphopenia) or with comorbidities associated with poor outcomes (cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes) were not only in the HC or HC+AZ groups, as a substantial fraction of these patients were also in the no HC group.',\n",

Of note, a randomized, controlled trial of high-dose chloroquine, the parent compound of hydroxychloroquine that also has been reported to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and similar peak serum concentrations in humans, was halted prematurely due to cardiac toxicity and higher fatality rates in the high-dose chloroquine-treated COVID-19 patients. 22 In this retrospective study, after adjusting for several relevant confounders, no benefit from hydroxychloroquine treatment with or without azithromycin was observed in survival outcomes, the need for mechanical ventilation, or length of stay among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.',\n",

For example, because we studied data from a comprehensive electronic medical record rather than from an administrative health insurance claims database, we used rigorously identified covariates and outcomes. We studied patients in an integrated national healthcare system; therefore, the data are less susceptible to biases of single-center or regional studies. The median drug dosage and treatment duration of hydroxychloroquine of patients in this study indicate that the treatment regimen used was similar to the treatment regimens in The Outcomes Related to COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine among In-patients with symptomatic Disease (ORCHID) trial conducted by the NIH and several other randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO. A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by Spe-cialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine. An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.

       " 'Purpose The purpose of this review is to quantify the landscape of current clinical trials ongoing for therapies in the treatment of COVID-19. A secondary purpose is to examine the relationship between public and scientific interests in potential therapies for COVID-19. Methods A systematic search of clinicaltrials.gov was undertaken on April 22, 2020, to identify all currently registered clinical trials investigating potential therapies for patients with COVID-19. Public interest in the various therapies was quantified utilizing Google Trends. Public interest in hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was plotted against the cumulative number of active clinical trials evaluating antimalarials as potential COVID-19 therapies over time. Results There were 341 interventional studies and 208 different therapies actively registered on clinicaltrials.gov whose primary aim is the treatment of COVID-19. The median sample size was 120 patients (range 4-6000) with 154 (45%) trials reporting a planned sample size of 100 patients or less. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies. Following the spike in public interest, the average number of new trials increased tenfold with respect to antimalarial therapies.',\n",
       " 'The public interest and number of clinical trials involving antimalarials have far outpaced other potential therapies. The rise of clinical trials following the spike of public interest begs the question-are priorities and resources being allocated based on scientific merit, or driven by public consciousness and speculation? Public interest in hydroxychloroquine spiked after a non-randomized open-label clinical trial in France demonstrated reduced viral loads in COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [20] . These findings were widely promoted by prominent political leaders which spiked both public and scientific interest. However, the study was deeply flawed methodologically, and more recent studies have demonstrated no benefit [21] . Currently, no governing bodies recommend hydroxychloroquine as a potential therapeutic agent, and it is not being recommended for use outside clinical trials [22] . The emphasis on clinical trials investigating hydroxychloroquine may reduce the ability to test other promising therapies through a reduction in available resources and recruitment competition. This review is strengthened in its comprehensive inclusion of all registered therapeutic trials, allowing for an understanding of the current scientific landscape. It is limited by the surface-level nature in which the data was collected and grouped as well as the utilization of a single database in the interest of efficiency.',\n",
       " 'Recent global outbreak of the pandemic caused by coronavirus emphasizes the urgent need for novel antiviral therapeutics. It can be supplemented by utilization of efficient and validated drug discovery approaches such as drug repurposing/repositioning.

       " 'In the absence of sufficient clinical data, detailed information on safety, adverse effects, dose of aminoquinolines (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), etc. should be made available among health professionals who will dissipate it among patients. The successful application of available resources needs to be grounded in practices to minimize risk of rigorous screening and dose calculation.',\n",
       " 'COVID-19 disease is a highly contagious and particularly popular problem in all countries. A variety of repurposed drugs and investigational drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, lopinavir, interferon-beta, and other potential drugs have been studied for COVID19 treatment. We reviewed the potential dermatological side-effects of these drugs.',\n",
       " 'There are many reports available now, which are mostly observational or registry trial outcomes having varied results on coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients put on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination. Some are showing increased in-hospital mortality and ventricular arrhythmia increase, while some are showing overall benefit with significant viral RNA load reduction. Everyday things are getting more complicated with the publication of these different outcomes. This needs to be addressed.',\n",
       " 'It is likely that the severe COVID-19 patients are aged, fragile, and hemodynamically unstable with multiple existing comorbidities, and, hence they are prone to develop cardiac arrhythmias of all sorts. From the above facts, we can see that Asians are less susceptible than Caucasians in developing cardiac arrhythmias in general, but the scenario might not be Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol), antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones), antimycotics (fluconazole, voriconazole), antiviral drugs (atazanavir), antiemetics (ondansetron, domperidone), antidepressives (amitriptyline, sertraline), antipsychotics (haloperidol, clozapine), antimalarials (quinine, chloroquine, halofantrine, quinidine), and others applicable in the face of a cytokine storm that goes on in the severe COVID-19 patients. Hence, in these situations, we must maintain extreme cautiousness while prescribing these combination drugs, which can prolong the QT interval. Severe COVID-19 patients should be kept out of these potential arrhythmogenic drug combinations until we get the results from dedicated randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Until that time, we must use HCQ as a prophylactic drug in that population who have a normal baseline QTc or in patients with mild disease and not having any previous myocardial injury or CV risk factor and should be followed up closely with serial ECGs if needed to see any change after starting the drug. Similarly, AZ use should be restricted to mild COVID-19 infections only until further data is available in critically ill patients from RCTs.',\n",
       " 'Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate in regard to its potential antiviral activity against SARS-Cov-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Some report possible curative effects, others do not. In order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic, we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough (i.e. when viral loads range from 1 to 1,000 copies/mL). Although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported. Moreover, the effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively SARS-Cov-2-infected cells. On the whole, the present study suggests that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window, which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses. These considerations may have implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies.',\n",
       " 'The simulations that we provide confirm current hypotheses that the virologic response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients has a pharmacokinetic basis, and that the drug dosages with an acceptable toxicity profile have a narrow window of overlap with the antiviral effective concentrations. These results are in line with previous analyses of HIV clinical trials, showing that the dosages adopted safely in the clinic are in the lowest range of the therapeutic window, with significant, though yet partial, effects observable only at the highest doses administered [18] .',\n",
       " 'These observations are in line with the clinical data reported so far. A small trial in France suggested that hydroxychloroquine helps treat COVID-19 [3] and a small study from China [19] reported opposite results. Both studies have their own limitations and very limited statistical power, due to the fact that they were prepared during an emergency. The discrepancy of the results obtained may reside, according to the results of the present study, in dosage of hydroxychloroquine adopted, with the French study reporting positive results using 600 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine and the Chinese study being unable to show any efficacy following adoption of a lower dosage (400 mg/day). Furthermore, the reported response to hydroxychloroquine in the French study is incomplete, and the authors had to add another experimental drug repositioned as an antiviral (azithromycin) in order to increase efficacy. These considerations are in line with the results obtained in randomized clinical trials using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at an equivalent dosage superior to that reported in the two aforementioned studies [20] [21] [22] . As the safety margin of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is narrow [23] , administration of higher dosages is unfortunately hampered by toxicity, as shown by Borba et al. [22] , although recent data show that the toxicity observed by Borba et al. could in fact be ascribed by the concomitant administration of azithromycin [24] . Our results agree in part with the simulations conducted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , showing that only the 600 mg/day regimen might have a significant impact on viral replication according to all parameters that they adopted, and those of Garcia-Cremades et al. [26] , showing that a dosage higher than or equal to 600 mg/day is necessary to obtain a sustained remission. The approach that we have followed is more conservative than that adopted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , in that we used the whole blood concentrations as a measure of prediction of tissue accumulation rather than the predicted accumulation in the lung. According to the model adopted by Arnold and Buckner [25] , the drug lung concentrations are hundreds of times higher than those in plasma and are predicted to reach a concentration able to inhibit 100 percent of SARS-CoV-2 replication. We decided not to follow this prediction because 1) tissue accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung is mainly driven by tissue macrophages, which are not a main target for the virus, 2) according to the data published by Yao et al. [15] , 100 per cent of inhibition of coronavirus replication is not reachable experimentally using hydroxychloroquine. Also Smit et al. reached similar conclusions, based on pharmacokinetic considerations [23] .',\n",
       " 'Based on our simulations, we suggest that chloroquine may not be a \"silver bullet\" eradicating COVID-19 infection but, on the other side, it might display some beneficial effects in vivo . Our simulations go beyond the other models published, indicating that earlier virologic negativization should not be expected when hydroxychloroquine is administered at dosages of 400 mg/day but only at dosages of 600 mg/day, i.e.within the narrow therapeutic window. Instead, we believe that the theoretical capacity of hydroxychloroquine to decrease the viral load peak when viral replication is most active deserves attention and further investigation. The results of our simulations are in line with those of a recent meta analysis of the so far available clinical data, showing that hydroxychloroquine may decrease disease severity but not viral clearance when administered to symptomatic COVID-19 patients [27] .',\n",
       " 'Finally, we show that the effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine on antigen cross-presentation should be considered. Cross-presentation is a phenomenon in which a dendritic cell presents the antigen to CD8+ T-cells, improving their priming. Activation of CD8+ T-cells after priming through antigen recognition can induce the selective killing of the infected cells [16] . Taking into account this parameter it is possible to predict that hydroxychloroquine may accelerate viral clearance but only when administered early. Accordingly, we did not model a scenario of increased cell-mediated responses when viral loads are higher, because immune dysregulation is in this case likely to have taken place. Enhanced cell-mediated responses may not only induce selective killing of the infected cells but also enhance immunity for better long-term control of the infection.',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine is currently being investigated also as a prophylactic agent [29] . Given the great interest that this strategy has so far evoked in the context of COVID-19 [30, 31] , future vaccines against this disease should be considered in co-administration with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. In case chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine should prove ineffective in protecting from SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, it is plausible that it may mitigate disease severity by attenuating viral replication.',\n",
       " 'Background: COVID-19 pandemics is a challenge for public health and infectious diseases clinicians, especially for the therapeutical approach that is not yet adequately defined. Amid this situation, investigational agents are being used, including chloroquine.

Then, expert recommendations are rapidly assessing potential therapeutical drugs that may help in the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including chloroquine, as currently reported in many emerging interim guidelines [9] [10] [11] [12] . In Colombia, the Ministry of Health and the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases [38] , have considered the possible use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients, in those hospitalized under close medical observation, as was our case.',\n",

The current evidence suggesting the use of chloroquine, as we did, is only based on in vitro studies. At the moment, multiple randomized controlled trials are being conducted to test the effect of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 [41] . Nowadays, The effective concentrations (EC 90 ) of chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is 6.90 μM [15] , which is clinically achievable, well-tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and potentially applicable to COVID-19 patients, as we did. Our patient received 5 days of chloroquine per 5 days at 600 mg per day (divided into two doses, 300 mg/day base). That is the dose recommended by different interim guidelines [42] .',\n",

Although optimal dosing and duration of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, its use is being reported in different COVID-19 cases, as monotherapy or combined [7, 8, 15-20, 39-41, 43] . A recent structural and molecular modeling study showed that chloroquine binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity, and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Then, the identification of this new mechanism of action of chloroquine supports its potential use the SARS-CoV-2 infection [45] .',\n",

In the case of chloroquine, it appears that fusion and un-coating blockade, by lysosomal alkalization [49, 50] ; interaction with the ACE2 receptor [49, 50] ; and immuno-modulation act as a mechanism to control SARS-CoV-2 infection [42] .',\n",
       " 'Our patient, instead of azithromycin, received clarithromycin. Both inhibit protein synthesis in susceptible organisms (e.g. bacteria) by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Clarithromycin is several-fold more active in vitro than erythromycin against gram-positive organisms, while azithromycin is 2-to 4-fold less potent [46] . Clarithromycin has a longer serum halflife and better tissue penetration than erythromycin, allowing twice-a-day dosing for most common infections [46] . In addition to common bacteria, azithromycin and clarithromycin have demonstrated to be also active against some unexpected pathogens (e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycobacterium avium complex, and M. leprae), and maybe also for SARS-CoV-2 [46] . The efficacy of clarithromycin has been examined against H5N1 highly pathogenic and H7N9 low pathogenic avian influenza virus infections in cynomolgus monkeys, showing viral suppression and clinical improvement [51] . A study assessed the efficacy and safety of a clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination for the treatment of serious influenza, also showing good results, reducing both 30-and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay [52] . Then, the antiviral activity and clinical studies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or clarithromycin, as monotherapy or especially in combination, should be specially assessed in the immediate future.',\n",

       " 'Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions. Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported.',\n",
       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already being used extensively, and often in high doses, to prevent and treat COVID19 despite the current lack of convincing evidence of benefit. The large randomised trials which should provide definitive evidence on treatment efficacy will not report for another few months, and prevention trials will take longer. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have unusual pharmacokinetic properties with enormous total apparent volumes of distribution (V d ) (chloroquine>hydroxychloroquine) and very slow elimination (terminal half-lives exceed one month). Thus distribution processes rather than elimination govern the blood concentration profiles in the first days following the start of treatment. Large single doses are very dangerous because they result in high blood concentrations as the drugs distribute out from a central \"compartment\" that is hundreds of times smaller than the total V d (conventional compartmental modelling of chloroquine pharmacokinetics provides only an approximation of the distribution processes). These high concentrations cause potentially lethal cardiovascular and nervous system toxicity. There is concentration dependent electrocardiograph QRS widening and QT prolongation [14] . Death usually results from refractory hypotension or ventricular fibrillation. Self-poisoning with chloroquine provides an unfortunate opportunity to correlate drug exposure with the risk of iatrogenic death. The toxicokinetic-pharmacodynamic model developed here was based on the largest prospective series of chloroquine self-poisonings studied in a single referral centre. It was based on a majority of admission whole blood concentrations. The data from patients whose peak concentration occurred after hospital admission were used to approximate peak concentrations in the remaining patients. Overall, the admission concentrations were estimated to be approximately 5% lower on average than the peak concentrations. This corresponds to prior expectations: the mean interval to hospitalisation for this large self-poisoning cohort was 4.5 hours compared with an average time to peak concentration after oral administration of 3 hours (range 1-6 hours) [14] . This analysis does not make any prediction for hydroxychloroquine toxicity which is pharmacologically similar to chloroquine. The clinical features of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine overdose are similar, although hydroxychloroquine is considered safer, with a wider therapeutic margin in experimental animals [22] . Unlike chloroquine, there are no large cohorts of hydroxychloroquine poisoning on which to base the PK-PD relationship. Thus, given available safety data, is very unlikely that equivalent hydroxychloroquine concentrations to chloroquine are more dangerous.',\n",
       " 'The high dose chloroquine regimen used by Borba et al [6] was justified on the basis of the recommendations by the Health Commission of Guangdong Province [18] but there may have been confusion between salt and base weights. The Chinese authorities recommended 500mg salt twice daily (two tablets of 250mg, comprising 155mg base each). This is the flat dose regimen we simulated (with an additional loading dose on day 1) which has an acceptable safety profile whereas the regimen trialled in Brazil [6] gave doses in base equivalent (which were almost twice those recommended by the Chinese authorities).',\n",
       " 'There are several limitations to this study. It is a retrospective individual patient data analysis. In the suicide attempts, other drugs or alcohol were often taken as well, although none with the acute lethal toxicity of chloroquine. The spectrophotometric assay method does not separate chloroquine from its desethylated metabolite, and is relatively insensitive. Desethychloroquine has generally similar biological properties, and the assay performs well at the high concentrations of relevance to this study. We corrected for the presence of the metabolite under the Bayesian model, but this correction increases uncertainty around the threshold concentration associated with 1% mortality.',\n",
       " 'Patients were managed by experienced intensivists on intensive care units where there was close clinical and laboratory monitoring. Mortality might be higher in less well supported settings, or overloaded hospitals in high-income settings. Hypokalaemia is an important manifestation of chloroquine poisoning and a contributor to tachyarrhythmias. With high dose regimens plasma potassium concentrations should be maintained over 4.0mmol/L and plasma magnesium concentrations over 0.8mmol/L. The predictions of absolute mortality under the regimens simulated in this work are sensitive to the parameterization of the pharmacokinetic model. C max is not usually directly observed but is a parameter estimated from data. There are no large population pharmacokinetic studies on which to verify the precision of the C max predictions, especially for the tails of the distribution.',\n",

A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication. Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

[9] Disease flares can potentially be induced by the COVID-19, as seen in RDs by most endogenous retroviruses as well as acquired viral infections. [8] Previously higher risk of infections has been reported in those with higher disease activity, and vice versa. [8] While most rheumatologists believed that COVID-19 may trigger MAS, it might be difficult to distinguish cytopenia and hyperferritinemia due to increased disease activity. The consensus was on the use of Tocilizumab in MAS, possibly backed by a case series, which remains to be confirmed in ongoing trials. [10] The feasibility of screening for SARS-CoV-2 before initiation of bDMARDs needs to be explored as previously suggested. [11] There was unanimous agreement on use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19, with more than two-thirds weighing towards initiating it in patients with otherwise low evidence diseasespecific indications. This may be attributed to less toxic nature, fewer interactions, a wider therapeutic index, greater in-vitro efficacy against the COVID-19 and years of experience of rheumatologists. [12] A prominent national regulatory body has issued an advisory favouring prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine for healthcare workers and close contacts of patients with COVID-19 [13] However, caution is needed as reports of toxicity have emerged with the use of prophylaxis. [14] The usage of ACEi/ARBs was debateable; there exists little evidence to recommend continuation or discontinuation of either drug. [15] In times of widespread travel bans and jeopardised medical services, there is a felt need for shift to virtual consulting. India recently legalised teleconsultations to the same effect. [16] A pandemic of such magnitude is not without psychologic impact on the treating physicians either. The dominant fears in this situation were mostly related to transmission to family and the patients. The management of the disease was most likely to be affected in the CTD spectrum of RDs, suggesting the need to develop evidence for a triage-in-rheumatology protocol bracing for the times ahead.',\n",

For the prevention and control of the infection in public, it seems that well application of infection control measurements, including hand hygiene, general contact measurements, respiratory protection measurements are very important [4] . At the beginning of the outbreak, quarantine and isolation procedures have been used very strictly in the entire world. Many countries evacuated their people living in risky areas or outbreak seen cities in China by airplane. Exposed people have been isolated in restricted areas in their countries for 14 days. Some countries closed their borders. Many cruise ships carrying suspected infected tourists were quarantined in the harbor for 14 days as an example implicated in Italy, the USA and Japan. During the outbreak period, international travel was banned and international flights were suspended or stopped. This kind of measurement was used very dynamical [5] .

       " \"The majority of participants indicated that they will be able to act if they suspected that a patient has COVID-19. One of the important aspects of pharmacy practice in the context of pharmaceutical care is being able to triage patients to appropriate health care. 44 Furthermore, the majority of participants were willing to deliver medicines to patients' homes. This is not required by the Jordanian Drug and Pharmacy laws and in fact pharmacists are not allowed to adopt a courier home delivery service. 45 Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic only registered pharmacists were allowed to deliver medications. This would be an effective service especially for elderly patients were the risk of infection and its complication are increased, although of course the delivery personnel should probably be pharmacy staff/trainee pharmacists to 'free-up' pharmacy capacity in a pandemic situation. 19 Some participants indicated that they were willing to dispense hydroxychloroquine directly to patients. This is quite surprising as hydroxychloroquine has been regulated by the Jordan Food and Drug Administration and is not allowed to be sold in the community pharmacy without a valid prescription. Furthermore, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine has not been thoroughly established for COVID-19 # using simple linear regression, $ using multiple linear regression, * significant at 0.05 significance level. and the medication has a risk: benefit profile that requires clinical supervision when used. Participants' willingness to dispense without prescription may be influenced by the media which has been proposing hydroxychloroquine as the treatment of COVID-19. About 95% of participants in this study reported that they currently follow the latest coronavirus updates on treatments obtaining their information mostly (60% of them) from the media. Highlighting more reliable sources such as the FIP released guideline in March of this year could benefit in providing accurate information to pharmacists globally, by clarifying required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce, and presenting evidence-based information. 11 Many pharmacists were not sure about the role of hydroxychloroquine (12%) and 29% of them thought it has been used as a preventative therapy against the coronavirus infection. It may be posed that Jordanian pharmacists need to be made aware about current preliminary recommendations for the symptomatic management of mild COVID-19 cases, i.e.fluids, antipyretics and rest. Specialist hospital unit physicians of course have trialed and may be using treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, as well as of course ventilatory support for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms. 46 Most participants (72%) knew that azithromycin has been trialed along with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of the coronavirus infection, while only 28% knew that antivirals, such as oseltamivir, have been used in the management in critical cases of the infection and 46% were not sure. 46 Ibuprofen the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, or NSAID, is sold under a number of brand names, including Advil® and Nurofen®. In addition to treating pain, it's often used to manage fever associated with various viral or bacterial infections. At the time of designing this study, it was said that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections (including the coronavirus infection). However, the WHO declared on March 18, 2020 under a post titled 'Anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports' that 'there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition'. Earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus until WHO experts could investigate'. This case provides a good example on the confusing information provided to healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, via the media regarding COVID-19 pandemic. 47 The use of corticosteroids by COVID-19 patients has also been a confusing issue to many pharmacists. Corticosteroids were widely used during previous outbreaks of similar types of infection such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. 48 However, although there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if used in the early acute phase of infections, conflicting evidence from the WHO surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. 49 Current reports indicate no unique reason exists to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment. 50 Hence, considering the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. 51 Pharmacists and pharmacy students showed acceptable awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic as more than half of them knew the correct answers to the awareness related items except for the items probing the appropriate distance they need to maintain between them and the patients; the majority (67%) believed that at least 3 m (10 feet) were the needed distance when counseling patients during a pandemic while the appropriate answer as per Jordanian guidelines is 2 m (6 feet) and 7% were not sure. It was important to raise awareness about this fact (as participants received the correct answers upon completion of the study), because anecdotal comments from pharmacists indicated that some did not allow customers to come anywhere near them which negatively affected the counseling process. The majority (76%) of them were not aware of the highest risk population group in terms of contracting the coronavirus infection and they believed that children under the age of 9 were at highest risk along with and to the same extent as the elderly (>65) and immune-compromised patients, while 5% were not sure. It was interesting to note that generally significantly more pharmacists answered the awareness items on the survey correctly than pharmacy student. This may indicate the experience boosts clinical awareness and reasoning skills of pharmacists. Study results indicated that not only being a practicing pharmacist versus a pharmacy student was associated with better awareness, but that older age, being a public university alumnus versus a private university alumnus, attending more educational workshops on a yearly basis were also significantly associated with a better level of awareness. None of these are of course surprising except of course the difference in graduating from a different type of educational institution (public vs. private). It is noteworthy to recognize that this finding could be due to the fact that about half of the graduates from the private educational institutions in Jordan are international students, who travel back to their countries once they graduate; international students who remain in Jordan are not able to practice as pharmacists.\",\n",

These recommendations were based on demographic and clinical conditions such as age, fever, hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltration. Guidelines suggest discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors and antiproliferative agents with increasing the steroid dosage in hypoxemic patients. There is no consensus in milder cases. Hence, one of them recommends the withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors and antiproliferative agents, while the other suggests the continuation of calcineurin inhibitors with halving the dose (through level 4-6 ng/ml) during SARS-CoV-2 infection [6, 8] .

There are at least 291 clinical trials investigating pharmacologic therapy for adult patients with COVID-19 [9] . HCQ and azithromycin were used in a clinical trial to manage patients with COVID-19 [10] . HCQ and chloroquine are thought to inhibit binding of ACE2 receptors on host cell with the spike protein on the surface of beta coronavirus [11] . Despite its widespread use, so far there is lack of strong evidence to support the role of HCQ or chloroquine in improving outcomes [9] . Patients with refractory hypoxemia were recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation by WHO [12] , convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are also being used in various clinical trials as potential treatment options for critically ill patients [13] . The rationale behind using this treatment is that antibodies from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection can probably help in clearance of free virus as well as infected cells [9] .',\n",
       " 'The outbreak of viral pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that began in December 2019 caused high mortality. It has been suggested that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 may be an important target to discover pharmaceutical compounds for the therapy of this life-threatening disease. Remdesivir, ritonavir and chloroquine have all been reported to play a role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2. Here, we applied a molecular docking method to study the binding stability of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It appeared that the ligand-protein binding stability of the alliin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was better than others. The results suggested that alliin may serve as a good candidate as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       " \"To understand the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we aligned the protein sequences of the two viruses. Figure 1 shows the coincidence of their 3D proteins; the root-mean-square deviation value between them is 0.585Å, which shows that the two viruses' Mpros are similar. According to reports of the Wuhan Virus Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Toxicology and Pharmaceuticals of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, remdesivir, ritonavir and chloroquine might play a role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level. In this study, we used a molecular docking method to study the binding of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and compared the potential inhibitory effects of alliin on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro.\",\n",
       " 'The molecular docking results revealed a high affinity between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the four ligands, as shown in Table 1 ; the molecular docking scores of SARS-CoV Mpro and alliin are also listed. As shown in Figure 2A , remdesivir was found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at Asn-142, Ser-144 and His-41 with two H-bonds and one arene H-bond. Figure 2B shows that ritonavir was observed to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at Met-49, Glu-166 and Thr-26 with two H-bonds and one arene H-bond. As shown in Figure 2C , chloroquine was found to be interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at His-41 and Met-49 with two arene H-bonds. Finally, as shown in It has been reported that inhibiting the main protease would help to restrict viral maturation, thereby reducing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans [13] . The active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is located in the gap between domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184) and has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) [14, 15] . A recent article indicated that montelukast, a potential drug acting on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, was well fitted into the active pocket of Mpro, in which hydrophobic amino acids (Thr24, Leu27, His41, Phe140, Cys145, His163, Met165, Pro168 and His172) compose a relatively hydrophobic environment to contain the compound and stabilize its conformation [16] . In another study, Qamar et al. revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) consistent with the SARS chymotrypsin-like protease (Cys-145 and His-41) [17] . The authors indicated that 5,7,3 ,4 -tetrahydroxy-2 -(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone, a potential candidate for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, formed strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) and had significant interactions with the receptor-binding residues Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Cys44, Thr45, Ser46, Met49, Asn142, Gly143, His164, Glu166 and Gln189 [18] . Consistent with this, in our study alliin was well fitted into the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, containing many amino acids, such as His41, His164, Met165, Asp187, Arg188 and Gln189, which formed significant interactions with Vol. 69 No. 8 C 2020 Bijun Cheng www.BioTechniques.com the compound and stabilized its conformation. In addition, the docking scores indicated the strength of the ligand-protein complexes, with lower values indicating greater stability.

These compounds were designed from virtual screening experiments in two compound databases, one being previously built from docking compounds with M pro , and the other was built from compounds with known anti-SARS activity. From these virtual screening experiments here performed, we selected the 100 top-ranked hits from each base. Their ADME/Tox properties were calculated and compared to those of drugs currently being tested with COVID-19, by attempting to reposition of the function, among known antivirals and hydroxychloroquine, a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as others inflammatory diseases. Our compounds designed and here presented showed pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties even more satisfactory and suitable than the drugs currently in test with COVID-19, in addition to maintain a network of favorable intermolecular interactions with the M pro of the new coronavirus, according to the docking studies here performed with such enzyme. Also, an inhibitor was selected serving as a template for study of similarity and drug repurposing and it was possible to identify Apixaban, an known anticoagulant administered by the oral route, which shows very promising results for future treatment of COVID-19. Due to the suitable pharmacotherapeutic profile as well as very low toxicity and adverse effects, thus estimated for our potential M pro inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we suggest our most promising compound as well as Apixaban as proposals for alternative tests with COVID-19, for future treatment of patients affected with this severe acute respiratory syndrome.',\n",

Most of the trials excluded CKD and particularly ESRD patients, for a higher possibility of side effects and difficulty with dose adjustment. The nephrologists should be mindful of the renal dosing of any experimental drugs in CKD, hemodialysis, and PD patients. Our patient remained clinically stable and was not subjected to any experimental medications. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was not checked in peritoneal effluent before. We do not know the benefit of the effluent testing for COVID-19, given the current lack of testing kits, and unsure if it is likely to change the management. In COVID-positive patient, discarding effluent at home should be in the drain where nobody has access, and handling by the close contacts should be discouraged.

Benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection have been proposed and clinical trials are underway. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, typically used for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, have been considered for off-label use in several countries. In the literature, there are reports of ototoxic effects of the drugs causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or imbalance. This mini-review represents a summary of the findings from a systematic search regarding ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the published literature. The characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment can be temporary but reports of persistent auditory and vestibular dysfunction exist. These are not frequent, but the impact can be substantial. Additionally, abnormal cochleovestibular development in the newborn was also reported after chloroquine treatment in pregnant women. The suggested dose of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection is considerably higher than the usual dosage for malaria treatment; therefore, it is plausible that the ototoxic effects will be greater. There are potential implications from this review for survivors of COVID-19 treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss, tinnitus and/or imbalance are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation and interventions once they are stable.

       " 'The \"rank\" column indicates the ranked position for a given model by binding prediction controlled clinical trials. During a global pandemic, however, time may not allow for usual drug development processes and repurposing of commonly available drugs may be critical. Indeed, anecdotal reports of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and anti-IL6 therapies have received attention [21, 22] . While hydroxychloroquine was predicted to bind to ACE2 by model b, supporting the anecdotal reports, we did not detect azithromycin or anti-IL-6 agents as these would not be anticipated to mediate therapeutic activity through ACE2 modulation. Further validation will be needed to determine if unbiased AI-based systems approaches are superior to anecdotal observations. In the binding prediction analysis, multiple known drugs were identified as potential ACE2 inhibitors (Table 1) . Not surprisingly, twelve were ACE inhibitors. This adds some confirmation that the unbiased selection accurately identified drugs with high likelihood of receptor binding. ACE inhibitors are agents commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. This family of drugs are based on various peptide compositions and were initially selected for binding to ACE1, which catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), lowering systemic blood pressure, increasing sodium excretion and increased renal water output. ACE inhibitors are not known to bind to ACE2, which lacks the carboxypeptidase activity of ACE1, but does contain a zinc-binding domain, exhibits metallopeptidase activity and shares approximately 40% homology with ACE1 [23, 24] . Our model selected for preferential ACE2 binding and agents with better predicted binding values were prioritized (see Table 1 ). Early studies largely used angiotensin catalysis as the major readout for inhibition and whether current ACE inhibitors may block SARS-CoV-2 binding remains speculative [25] . In addition, due to the counter regulatory nature of ACE1 and ACE2 expression, it is possible that agents that downregulate ACE1 receptors may increase ACE2 receptor expression and could worsen coronavirus infection. Thus, we scanned for binding of both ACE1 and ACE2 for top hits, and ranked by predicted difference in binding. By this metric, Captopril, Enalaprilat and Monopril looked likely to inhibit both and potentially solicit this undesired feedback effect (Table 1) . Ramipril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat in the liver and may be associated with hepatic injury. Likewise, monopril is a pro-drug that undergoes transformation in the liver to the active metabolite fosinoprilat. In contrast, lisinopril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that does not undergo metabolic transformation and is excreted in the urine and does not bind to other serum proteins but may also be associated with hepatic toxicity and these drugs need to be used cautiously in patients with underlying liver disease. Captopril is a sulfhydryl-containing proline analog with potent and specific activity in blocking ACE peptidyl-dipeptidase activity. Captopril may also have anti-tumor activity through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and promotion of anti-tumor immunity [26] .',\n",

In this paper, our objectives are to characterize the public discussion of treatments on Twitter, and demonstrate the utility of these discussions for public health surveillance. We pulled tweets related to three promising COVID-19 treatments (hydroxychloroquine, remdevisir and convalescent plasma), between the dates of February 28th and May 22nd using the Twitter public API. We characterize treatment tweet trends over this time period. Most major tweet/retweet/sentiment trends correlated to public announcement made by the white house and/or to new clinical trial evidence about treatments. Most of the websites people shared in treatment-related tweets were nonscientific media sources that leaned conservative. Hydroxychloroquine was the most discussed treatment on Twitter, and over 10% of hydroxychloroquine tweets mentioned an adverse drug reaction. There is a gap between the public attention/discussion around COVID-19 treatments and their evidence.

As an example, before evidence of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 came out, the white house advertised it, doctors over prescribed it, and governments stockpiled it. We've seen from the rapid pace of preprint articles, and premature publishing of the Surgisphere papers,[9] that science during a pandemic is messy.

So far, we have tested more than 25 compounds and their combinations, and confirmed the effect of hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir, the most potent antivirals of this screening, that did not increase their potency in combination. Remdesivir is not suitable for oral delivery as its poor hepatic stability would likely result in almost complete first-pass clearance (EMA, 2020), and therefore requires intravenous injection that complicates its use.

The mortality rate for patients in this age group is 8.0%, and given the patient's numerous comorbidities, his risk was likely higher [7] [8] .

First, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine reduce the glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which the SARS-CoV-2 use to enter host cells (Figure 4) [7]. Second, it is hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines whose expression lead to the ARDS pathway [8] . Finally, large amounts of the virus are known to enter host cells through endocytosis. Chloroquine accumulates in endosomes, decreasing the space available for viruses like SARS-CoV-2, and also raises endosomal pH, interfering with the entry and exit of viruses from host cells [9] . Although a potential mechanism for azithromycin is not well-defined, it is noted that in the oft-cited French study showing decreased COVID viral loads, 70% of patients in the group who received hydroxychloroquine alone showed no viral load by Day 6, while 100% of patients in the group who received hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin showed no viral load by Day 6 (versus 12.5% patients who received no treatment at all), pointing to a synergistic effect with hydroxychloroquine [4] .',\n",

Similarly, chloroquine was active in ex vivo studies but not in the in vivo studies against ebolavirus, nipah and influenza viruses [31e33]. Data of chloroquine against chikungunya virus is even more intriguing. While chloroquine had satisfactory antiviral activity against chikungunya in vitro, animal studies showed increase in virus replication, aggravation of fever and incomplete viral clearance [34] . Human trials of chloroquine showed no improvement in chikungunya acute illness and rather an increase in chronic arthralgia was observed during post-illness period, compared to the controls [35] . The role of chloroquine against Human Immunodeficiency Virus was inconclusive [36] . The only viral disease where chloroquine was modestly effective so far before COVID-19 era was chronic hepatitis C suggesting an increased virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin [37] . Therefore, the results of chloroquine and HCQ so far done against COVID-19, more promising than previous trial in other viral diseases. Moreover, these drugs are of low cost, reasonably safe (see below), and widely available in countries where malaria is endemic.',\n",

We have summarized current consideration and proposed line of management in Table 3 . The low cost of chloroquine and HCQ could also be an effective strategy to counter COVID-19 (especially in patients with diabetes and other co-morbidities in whom mortality is high) in resource constrained and COVID-19 overburdened heath care systems in middle-and low-income counties including India.

The Cmax to EC50 ratio of bexarotene for SARS-CoV-2 (1.69) is higher than those achieved with standard dosing of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin (0.02 to 1.04). Moreover, the time required to achieve Cmax (Tmax) with standard oral dosing of bexarotene is short (2.5 hours), which is important especially in COVID-19 patients who are acutely ill with rapid clinical deterioration [39] .

       " 'The co-administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin is proposed in COVID-19 therapy. We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone.',\n",
       " 'To our knowledge, the study described here was the first quantitative analysis of the early impact of COVID-19 on an inpatient pharmacy department in the United States. Although several papers suggesting services that pharmacists can provide to improve patient care in the current pandemic have been published, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] most of these editorials lack discussions of the complicated inpatient context in which pharmacists in impacted areas are currently working. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic will require rethinking of the traditional role and expected outcomes of inpatient pharmacy services. Traditional pharmacy efficiency benchmarks such as order verification and pharmacokinetic monitoring were reduced in our population due to changes in census and the underlying population. The clinical changes were offset by a corresponding increase in the number of CMRs performed for inpatients, while other clinical services did not change substantially from baseline. At our institution, CMRs often consist of pharmacist interventions that have been cost-justified in the past, such as renal dose adjustment, i.v.-to-oral conversion, and antibiotic de-escalation. [23] [24] [25] However, CMRs in this period also included activities unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. These interventions included retiming of blood sampling for laboratory testing and retiming of medication administrations to limit nurse visits into patient rooms, which may have served to preserve personal protective equipment and reduced the risk of viral transmission to nurses. 26 Additionally, CMRs included ensuring providers were following health-system COVID-19 guidelines with respect to monitoring for adverse effects, such as QT interval prolongation with hydroxychloroquine use (with or without azithromycin therapy). The lack of previously published literature suggesting clinical and/or economic benefit of these interventions does not mean that these interventions are not providing significant benefit to patients and health systems. Unfortunately, financial justification of services during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely relevant. The complicated decision of how best to use pharmacists in SARS-CoV-2-related patient care in the inpatient setting is occurring against the backdrop of numerous public reports regarding layoffs of nonessential healthcare personnel nationwide. 27 Thus, documentation of services will remain important for the pharmacy profession going forward to justify these services as more data come forth.',\n",

We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virusinduced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-α, interferon-λ1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2-and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon-α and inflammatory cytokines.

Results from PubMed database showed an incidence of 0.6% of cardiac-related side effects and 7.42% of other self-limiting and minor side effects among the Indian population on HCQ. Considering its minimal risk and favorable safety profile, cost-effectiveness, availability, and affordability in India, the use of hydroxychloroquine in the fight against COVID-19 appears rationale. Following the results of our study, we hypothesize that Indians might be less likely to suffer from cardiac-related side effects given their genetic make-up. However, this would need further studies, clinical trials, and a pharmacogenomic understanding of the subject.',\n",
       " 'Hydroxychloroquine came as a beacon of hope in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Given its dubious safety profile, there are two schools of thought about using HCQ for chemoprophylaxis. However, we believe that there might be more to the story than that meets the eye. It might not be prudent to replicate the number of adverse reactions observed in Western population and superimpose them on the Indian patient.',\n",
       " 'We also searched Vigiaccess [13] , the online database for ICSRs (Individual case Safety Reports) for information regarding geographic distribution of ADRs. However, it only gave data in broad headings of Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, thereby limiting our data collection. It was interesting to note that Americas noted 56% of the ADRs from use of hydroxychloroquine, Europe 27%, and Asia 14%. However, it should be borne in mind that underreporting could also be an attributing factor to this.',\n",

Many papers quoted these reactions as self-limiting and deemed it unimportant to report. & Multi-centric and multi-ethnic cohorts that were used for RCTs did not mention the race of the individual whose ADR was recorded. We have, however, included the number of events mentioned because we believed it was better to err on the higher side (for example, this was true for one of the deaths that were reported by a multi-centric study conducted across Asia, Table 1 ). & Similarly, the case report that mentioned recurrent syncopal attacks as a drug reaction lacks the proof for the same. It was hypothesized that it could be from the disease process (rheumatoid arthritis-nodule in the heart tissue, in this case) or from cardiotoxicity due to the drug. We, however, included the event in the study, in an attempt to be more inclusive of possible adverse reactions (Table 1 ) & We also found an article that reported ADRs of many different drugs in a tertiary care during a specified period of time, but we could not use this article due to lack of information on the denominator, that is, the total number of patients receiving the drug in the study setup. & Lastly, an important data that was elusive in these studies was details pertaining to demographic variables, comorbidities, any underlying structural heart diseases, history of co-administration with other QT interval prolonging medications such as macrolides, quinolones, antihistaminics, antiviral, antiarrhythmic, or antifungal drugs. & Apart from these limitations, it is important to note that chloroquine is more widely available in the Indian context given its continued use against malaria, while HCQ is more often prescribed for inflammatory conditions. Therefore, this further impedes our data collection with reference to HCQ adverse effects.',\n",

       " 'Patients admitted to hospital for infection due to the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) usually show pneumonia and acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure with a wide range of severity, up to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] . These patients, especially in the most severe cases requiring mechanical ventilation, carry a high thromboembolic risk; therefore, prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines [2] . Here, we report a case of a 43-year-old, otherwise healthy man who had never smoked, who was admitted to hospital for acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and who subsequently developed acute pulmonary embolism. The patient initially complained of fever and diarrhoea; after a few days, dyspnoea and posterior chest pain developed, and he was eventually admitted. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (oxygen tension (P O 2 ) 59 mmHg, carbon dioxide tension 41 mmHg and pH 7.47 while breathing room air); chest radiography demonstrated pale lung shadowing in the left lower lobe. Routine biochemistry showed moderate lymphopenia (770 per mm 3 ) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (11.81 mg·dL −1 ) and D-dimer (4.72 μg·mL −1 ) levels; troponin-T was within the normal range in two consecutive samples. ECG was deemed essentially normal by a cardiology consultant. Physical examination revealed reduced respiratory sound in the lower left hemithorax. Heart examination was normal. There was no leg swelling with negative Bauer and Homans signs in both limbs. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily, ceftriaxone 2 mg once daily and oxygen until a target saturation (96%) was reached; a standard prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily was immediately started. Despite fever disappearance and improvement of dyspnoea within few days, the patient still complained of left posterior chest pain. Lung ultrasound showed bilateral pleural effusion (more prominent in the left lung), with few B-lines bilaterally. ABG still showed a relative hypoxaemia (P O 2 between 60 and 62 mmHg while breathing room air) and blood tests showed, despite an improvement in lymphocyte count and in CRP levels, increased D-dimer values (up to 13.13 μg·mL −1 ). The patient had no angina, tachycardia or syncope, and haemodynamics had always been normal. Given the persistence of lung effusion, back chest pain and relative hypoxaemia, we suspected a coexisting pulmonary embolism, and a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed, which revealed bilateral emboli, more represented in the lower lobar and segmental branches of the right pulmonary arteries, with bilateral pleural effusion (especially in the left lung), without significant parenchymal consolidations (figure 1). Lower limb vein ultrasound showed no signs of deep vein thrombosis and an echocardiogram was normal. Treatment with fondaparinux 7.5 mg once daily was promptly started and over the following days, an improvement in symptoms and ABGs was observed.',\n",
       " \"Background: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the COVID-19. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications.\",\n",
       " 'Anticipation of potential neuropsychiatric sequela from chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment of COVID-19 requires extrapolation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine research in treatment of rheumatological disease and chemoprophylaxis for malaria. Neuropsychiatric side effects are uncommon in patients on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, although they are better described with chloroquine exposure than hydroxychloroquine exposure. Psychiatric symptom presentation during hospitalization for COVID-19 infection is much more likely to be due to delirium and adjustment disorder than neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The most studied neuropsychiatric phenomenon with these medications is \"psychosis following chloroquine,\" which may be prolonged in its resolution. Conversely, psychosis induced by hydroxychloroquine has been described only in a few case reports, and should be expected to be quite rare. Weak evidence suggests potential for increased anxiety symptoms or suicidal ideation with hydroxychloroquine exposure, although this evidence is based on a very limited research with unclear generalization. Given that pandemic stressors and neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 could possibly synergize with this possible increased suicide risk attributable to hydroxychloroquine, best practice may include screening for suicidal ideation and performance of a suicide risk assessment for patients on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment. Appropriate clinical practice can be better clarified by future research studying the association of hydroxychloroquine with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, particularly in the setting of COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment. Further psychiatric considerations include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine\\'s mild CYP2D6 inhibition, the potential for psychiatric medications to impact chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels and toxicity, and the potential increased risk of TdP when chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is combined with psychiatric medications that prolong the QT interval. The neuropsychiatric effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for treatment of COVID-19 have not been previously studied. Future research regarding the incidence and phenomenon of neuropsychiatric side effects in this clinical context may be helpful to guide future risk stratification.',\n",
       " 'COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health crisis threatening humanity at this point in time. Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase -Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.',\n",
       " 'Background: Since its first documentation, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has emerged worldwide, with the consequent declaration of a pandemic disease . Severe forms of acute respiratory failure can develop. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may affect organs other than the lung, such as the liver, with frequent onset of late cholestasis. We here report the histological findings of a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication of acute ischemic and gangrenous cholecystitis with a perforated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery. Case presentation: A 59-year-old Caucasian male, affected by acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the severity of the disease, invasive mechanical ventilation was instituted and SARS-CoV-2 treatment (azithromycin 250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg trice-daily) started. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was also administered subcutaneously. At day 8 of ICU admission, the clinical condition improved and patient was extubated. At day 32, patient revealed abdominal pain without signs of peritonism at examination, with increased inflammatory and cholestasis indexes at blood tests. At a first abdominal CT scan, perihepatic effusion and a relaxed gallbladder with dense content were detected. The surgeon decided to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The day after, conditions further worsened and a laparotomic cholecystectomy was performed. A relaxed and perforated ischemic gangrenous gallbladder, with a local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was intraoperatively met. The gallbladder and a sample of omentum, adherent to the gallbladder, were also sent for histological examination. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides display inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal obliteration of vessels, with wall breakthrough, hemorrhagic infarction, and nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder. The mucosa of the gallbladder appears also atrophic. Omentum vessels also appear largely thrombosed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti-CD31), while not in micro-vessels, with a remarkable activity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lymphocytes (anti-CD4) (Continued on next page)',\n",
       " 'Information on treatment of COVID-19 infection in renal transplant recipients is scarce, especially in symptomatic patients and patients with recent major clinical events. This group of patients suffers from different opportunistic infections which may coexist with COVID-19. Currently available expert opinions suggest reduction of immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with either antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Inspired by our experience in treatment of CMV pneumonia and literature data on the potential benefit of convalescent plasma for treatment of different viral diseases we suggest use of the hyperimmune anti-CMV gamma globulins in addition to other available therapies. Besides the immunosuppression reduction which is supposed to be beneficial, immunoglobulins with their immunomodulatory effects and possible antiviral role, may increase a possibility for favorable outcome.',\n",
       " \"Secondly, a different discussion can be made regarding the treatment used for malaria, which widely involves the use of chloroquine and its derivatives (in particular, hydroxychloroquine). These drugs are currently used in Western countries, mainly for some autoimmune disorders, and monitored over the years, particularly to verify their ocular toxicity ('chloroquine retinopathy').\",\n",
       " 'More recently, some authors have reported the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine at a dosage of 400 mg per day for ten days in the treatment of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [15] . The mechanism of action of these antimalarial drugs would result in an increase in endosomal pH by preventing the fusion between virus and cell, or interfering in the glycosylation process of cellular receptors of coronavirus. In addition, it is hypothesized that these antimalarials have an immunomodulating effect that contributes to increasing their efficacy in vivo [16] .',\n",
       " 'Of note, chloroquine is commonly used in several countries in the treatment and prevention of malaria despite drug resistance or government recommendations (also through its distribution in unofficial channels, especially in sub-Saharan Africa), due to its low price and wide availability [17] .',\n",
       " 'With similar characteristics to chloroquine, amodiaquine and mefloquine are also widely used in Africa as antimalarials with antiviral action against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [18] . Surprisingly, even some medications used in cases of chloroquine resistance (e.g., doxycycline, azithromycin) have demonstrated antiviral action against a large group of viruses [19] .',\n",
       " 'From all these considerations, it is possible to presume that the use of chloroquine, its derivatives, and other antimalarials may represent an unintentional chemoprophylaxis in African countries against Beta-CoVs epidemics, which potentially slows down the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, the involuntary achievement of an indirect protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection (similar to \"herd immunity\") for individuals who are not immune, in malaria countries, is likely to occur for different reasons. This slowdown of the epidemic in these countries may allow local populations to have extra time to implement all the rules for the prevention of contagion in an effective and timely manner.',\n",
       " 'Starting from the analysis of epidemiological data on malaria and on the effectiveness of antimalarials in the treatment of Beta-CoVs diseases, it is possible to state that scientific research is expected to verify the potential of antimalarials in reducing the spread of COVID-19 even in non-African countries. For instance, the effect of the administration of chloroquine derivatives in areas where malaria is endemic seems to preserve these geographic areas (i.e., the least developed countries) from COVID-19 outbreak, despite some rare side effects (e.g., retinal toxicity).',\n",
       " 'Testing these assumptions could have important implications for epidemic management strategies. Accordingly, at least 10 clinical trials are currently underway to verify the efficacy of chloroquine and its derivates for COVID-19 (e.g., NCT04261517, 2/14/20; ChiCTR2000029826, 2/2/20) [20] .

Even the mere prophylactic administration of chloroquine or its derivatives to 'exposed' health workers would help to ensure greater serenity in emergency management. The advantages would undoubtedly include the immediate availability of a very low-cost drug, whose side effects (e.g., toxic retinopathy), potential therapeutic doses, and contraindications, in some subcategories of the population (i.e., G6PD deficiency, pregnancy, etc.), have long been known.\",\n",

Further studies should be carried out promptly to verify the hypothesis presented here without overlooking the innumerable advantages given by the implementation of a suitable strategy in the shortest possible time frame. Delaying such studies could lead to unbearable loss in terms of human lives and economic resources.',\n",

Cardiac MRI showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, predominantly in the apical segments, and severe LV dysfunction (LVEF of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T2-mapping sequences depicted marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema and a diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. A circumferential pericardial effusion, especially around the right cardiac chambers, was also observed.

Our patient was tested negative three times with nasopharyngeal swabbings and subsequent RT-PCR testing. Initial false-negative RT-PCR testing is not uncommon. This is possibly due to the patient's early disease course with mild symptoms. One study involving 76 patients in Nanchang, China, found that the mean viral load of severe cases was around 60 times higher than that of mild cases, which suggests that higher viral loads are correlated with more severe cases [7] . Our patient had only mild symptoms with fever and shortness of breath at his initial presentation and he only needed oxygen via nasal cannula. In another retrospective cohort study by Northwell Heath facilities in New York, only 13/5600 patients (2%) had a negative first test and positive repeat test [2] . In addition, our patient was started on hydroxychloroquine with a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Recent cohort studies have demonstrated variable impact of HCQ with or without AZM on QT prolongation and electrical risk in patients with COVID-19. Rosenberg and colleagues 8 identified an increased risk of in-hospital cardiac arrest in patients treated with HCQ/AZM, but not HCQ monotherapy, when compared to those treated without either. In 233 patients treated with HCQ alone, they observed a 17% incidence of QT prolongation, although ECG assessment was not protocolized or adjudicated, HCQ dosing was heterogeneous, detailed information regarding quantitative QT measures were lacking, candidate ECGs were considered at any point during hospitalization, and QT prolongation was defined broadly. Mercuro and colleagues evaluate 90 patients treated with HCQ (maintenance dose 400mg daily), in whom 53 were additionally treated with AZM, and noted that 19% of patients treated with HCQ monotherapy and 21% of those treated with HCQ and AZM demonstrated a QTc interval longer than 500 msec. 7 Of note, the majority of these patients were taking two or more QTc prolonging medications. In a smaller study of 40 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit, Bessiere and colleagues observed a prolonged QTc (> 500 msec or increase > 60 msec) in 36% of patients treated with HCQ monotherapy (18 patients) or HCQ + AZM (22 patients). 6 Finally, Saleh and colleagues 12 evaluated 82 patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ or chloroquine monotherapy and 119 patients treated with HCQ + AZM. In patients treated with HCQ or chloroquine monotherapy, on-treatment QTc > 500 msec was observed in 7% although given the potential differential effects of chloroquine versus HCQ on QT prolongation, 13 the specific risk of HCQ monotherapy was less certain.',\n",

Methods This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (≥18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patient's data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir. Results The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93, P = 0.001). Conclusion This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.\",\n",

The use of therapeutic combination regimen including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir could be hypothetically capable of fighting COVID-19, especially in the case of antiviral effect of oseltamivir and the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine. Currently, there is no strong evidence for the use of oseltamivir and accumulating evidence does not considerably support the clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, while mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry is recommended due to cardiovascular risks of this antimalarial drug [38] .

The first human cases were documented in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and are thought to be a result of transmission through an intermediate host, likely the pangolin. Human-to-human disease transmission primarily occurs through respiratory droplets. Once in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 enters the pulmonary cells through endocytosis via the ACE-2 receptor. The mean incubation time is 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5-5.8 days), with 97.5% of those who develop symptoms doing so within 11.5 days (95% CI: 8.2-15.6 days). Symptoms may vary from mild to severe but are typical of other viral illnesses including Influenza. The basic reproduction number is reported to be between 2.13 and 4.82. Those most affected by COVID-19 are those of advanced age and those with pre-existing chronic medical conditions. Final mortality rates are currently unknown, as a large portion of cases have not yet resolved, but estimated case fatality is between 0.25% and 3.0%.

Management is usually multipronged. Intravenous rehydration to ensure urine output of 200-300 mL/hour (3 mL/kg of body weight per hour) is key to management [2] [3] [4] . Often patients may need to be transfused up to 10 L of fluids daily, depending on clinical features [2] . As dyselectrolytemia is often responsible for worse clinical outcomes, it should be corrected promptly and then monitored. The administration of sodium bicarbonate is recommended when metabolic acidosis is present concurrently and urine pH is less than 6.5. Furthermore, clinical improvement of the patient and normalization of laboratory parameters are also important markers.

Short term use, as expected for the treatment of COVID-19, is likely to pose a lower risk of cardiac toxicity, nevertheless the risk cannot be overlooked as patients are expected to be on higher doses, possibly concomitantly taking other QT prolonging agents, in addition to having a potentially elevated risk due to the disease itself.',\n",

Both duration of use and weight-based dosing (dose per kg) are important parameters for the risk of developing retinopathy [26] . The risk of retinal damage over a short time period may be negligible even with high doses [25] . However, given the seriousness of the outcome we have identified this as a key risk in the benefit-risk framework.

As further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available, this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing benefit-risk assessment.',\n",
       " 'We presented a multilayer analysis of cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, that spans from gene regulation to protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks. Nonviral diseases that appear on our list of enriched pathways indicate that virus response and gene dysregulation in other diseases are intertwined, partly explaining the success of drug repositioning currently being applied in treatment of COVID-19 patients. JAK-STAT inhibitors such as baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib are approved drugs for rheumatoid arthritis treatment and currently used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients through the suppression of elevated cytokine levels (Stebbing et al., 2020) . Hydroxychloroquine, a known antimalaria drug and has potential use in rheumatoid arthritis is used in patients (Colson et al., 2020) with promising results. Interactions between advanced glycation end product (AGE) and its receptor (RAGE) have a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia (Van Zoelen et al., 2011) and have potential use as biomarker or treatment method in inflammatory diseases (Hudson and Lippman, 2018) . To best of our knowledge, any direct evidence about SARS-CoV-2 and RAGE receptor relation is not yet reported in the literature. This pathway also shares ligands with Toll-like receptor family (Chavakis et al., 2004) . In addition to these pathways and genes, enriched GO-BP terms indicated that significantly changed genes are highly associated with response to lipopolysaccharide. Previous studies indicated that AGEs and lipopolysaccharides stimulate interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion via the RAGE/ TLR4-NF-κB-ROS pathways in mice (Ohtsu et al., 2017) . Levels of IL-6 found to have potential to predict respiratory failure in patients (Herold et al., 2020) . Thus far, specific signalling pathway associated drugs are used for SARS-CoV-2 patients to suppress the symptoms. This complex network structure between signalling pathways indicated that RAGE receptor targeting drugs have the potential to be used in SARS-CoV-2 patients to suppress symptoms.',\n",

A recent international consensus states that radiological assessment is not necessary in asymptomatic patients or those with mild disease but is required in patients with moderate or severe disease, regardless of whether a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made [20] . In addition, simple chest radiology [20] is preferable in a resourceconstrained environment with difficulties in accessing CAT scans [20] . The possible use of pulmonary ultrasound for the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia has not been sufficiently analysed but might be an efficient alternative due to its portability and reliability [21] . In fact, the regional Catalan government has recently acquired 90 ultrasound machines to enable family physicians to make doctors can make point-ofcare (home or nursing home) diagnoses of pneumonia [22] . Biologically, lymphopenia and increased CRP, LDH and D-dimer were usually constant and similar in all series and, together with a low platelet count were associated with an increased risk of mortality. A differential variable in our series is a greater number of alterations in liver tests, which was present in 30-40% of patients, data similar to the USA and Italian cohorts, but different from the Chinese cohort, where it was 22% [7] . We also found hypokalaemia in 20.5% of patients, a factor not reported in other studies. 1 1 We found a hospitalization rate of 48.7%, compared with 20-31% in the USA and 93.6% in China, and an ICU admission rate of 13%, which was similar to the Chinese (15%), USA (5-11.5%) and German (10%) results. While the protocols of action and admission are similar and depend on the level of clinical involvement, the therapeutic protocols differ between hospitals, cities, and countries. There remain many unknowns in the treatment of COVID-19. The only truth is that we do not have a vaccine, an etiological treatment or a treatment with sufficient scientific evidence to generalize its use. Currently, the systematic review of antiretroviral treatments has not offered conclusive results [23] and despite possibly encouraging in vitro results for hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19 infections are currently intractable [24, 25] .',\n",
       " 'Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease with a high morbidity and mortality by the FIP virus (FIPV, virulent feline coronavirus). Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed. We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-ω (IFN-ω) is effective for FIPV in vitro. A total of 100 µM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV. Interestingly, the combination of 100 µM of HCQ and 10 4 U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-ω (rfIFN-ω, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection. Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP. Antiviral drugs against FIP have been investigated for decades. In the past few years, several promising antivirals have been developed. GS-441524 (active triphosphate forms of Remdesivir) and GC-364 (3C-like protease inhibitor) have demonstrated great promise in the treatment of cats with FIP [9,10]. However, these drugs are not practically used for reasons of unavailable in veterinary medicine. Moreover, they will probably be expensive and can lead to antiviral resistance mutation [9, 10] .',\n",

COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology. Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used.

Also, the lack of vaccines and efficacious drugs to treat infected patients is a great problem to cope this pandemic. The approved drugs for similar health problems, reported potential drugs but not yet approved clinically or under clinical trial, and molecules from medicinal plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking, one of the best approach to search therapeutically potent drugs/molecules in real time with possible hope to apply on COVID-19. In this communication, molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with the three important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp). From the obtained results, we observed that all the tested molecules showed better dock score in compared to the hydroxychloroquine claimed to be effective against COVID-19. Combining the dock score and other medicinal properties, we believe the limonin can be further explored for potential use against COVID-19.\",\n",

We have selected the phytochemicals by considering their biological activities like antiviral, anticancer, antioxidant agent, anti-inflammatory agent, anti-dengue, antibacterial and antimicrobial. The 2D structures of some of the important ligands that showed good dock score including hydroxychloroquine are shown in chart 1. ',\n",

Our results revealed that all the tested phytochemicals showed higher dock score than the hydroxychloroquine, with the maximum dock score shown by the limonin. Limonin, the first isolated limonoid found in citrus fruits with bitter taste is known to inhibit the replication of retroviruses like HTLV-I and HIV- 12 1. Other important limonoid like azadirachtin is found in neem leaves and seeds. In Traditional Indian medicine, neem leaves are largely used for various medications (exceptionally some people shows allergy due to the bitter taste). Many other limonoids are also known for their potential biological activities. Therefore, with the combined docking results and the medicinal importance of limonin, we propose that the limonin and other limonoids can be studied further with the hope to get suitable inhibitors against the COVID-19.',\n",

Currently, there are no clinically confirmed antiviral treatment options. However, several drugs are now being clinically tested like chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir and favipiravir that can be targeted with the application of theranostics embedded into vesicular-delivery systems. The effectiveness, preciseness and safety of such advanced technologies have been documented before, nevertheless, further preclinical and clinical trials would validate the applications of these techniques in the treatment of COVID-19.',\n",

Both AAMs and CQ/HCQ are bitter tasted chloro compounds. Depending on their these two similar physical properties and the safety and efficacy of AAMs by controlling over post viral episodes as comparing with viral inhibitory activities including SARS-CoV-2 by CQ/HCQ, a reposition of AAMs either alone/combinedly could be rationalised as an antiviral approach to nCoV.',\n",

Montelukast, a known antiasthmatic/antileukotriene/antiallergic drug may have some viral inhibitory role to control COVID-19, need to explore, as recently reported by Yongkang Chen et al., 2020, that it can irreversibly inhibit the infectivity of Zika like flavivirus [4] and reported by Ahmad A et al., 2018, that it can reduce dengue (like flavivirus) shock syndrome [5] . Levocetirizine may stop cytokine storm as it inhibits the production of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and secretion of interleukin IL-6 and IL-8, which may have beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to human rhinovirus (HRV) infection in airway epithelial cells [6] . Flaviviruses, HRV and nCoV have common type of genetic material that is single stranded RNA. Both montelukast and levocetirizine, the two bitter [7] chloro compounds [8] , [9] , like chlorocquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) as CQ has bitter taste, that was described by Hans D Nothdurft and Kevin C Kain [10] and HCQ-it leaves a horrible bitter taste in the mouth, reported in India Today Insight [11] . CQ exerts direct antiviral effects inhibiting pH dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses and coronaviruses [12] . Also montelukast, can treat recurrent respiratory symptoms of post-respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in children [13] . Montelukast attenuates the frequency and severity of episodic wheezing in child patients due to upper respiratory tract infection caused by adenovirus, influenza, metapneumovirus, coronavirus [14] . Inventor, Bruce Chandler described in his european patent that combination of LCZ and MLK formulations are effective for treating influenza, common cold and associated acute inflammation [15] . Mi-Kyeong Kim et al., 2018 reported that a 4-week double-blind, randomized, multicenter phase 3 study was conducted to compare montelukast monotherapy vs combination therapy with montelukast plus levocetirizine in a cohort of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma. Resulting a fixeddose combination of montelukast plus levocetirizine was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis and asthma compared with montelukast alone, according to research [16] . SM Adsule et al., 2010 has reported in his review that the new generation antihistaminics are all safe, with negligible sedative effects, excellent tolerability and have no influence on cardiac parameters. Montelukast when used as monotherapy is efficacious and improves quality of life.

It is partinent to say, recently a hypothesis was reported by Cihan Fidan et al., 2020 where author has described that as a potential treatment of COVID-19, montelukast has an antiinflammatory role [19] . Whereas in the present hypothesis I would like to clearly emphasize that repurpose possibility of AAMs either alone (MLK/CLZ) or combination (MLK+LCZ) as antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 with special reference to CQ/HCQ. Also combination (MLK+LCZ), another option of therapy may be more effective than monotherapy (MLK/LCZ) [15] , [16] , [17] . Further more it has been strengthening the hypothesis from the reported evidences [4] , [5] , [6] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] that as the individual components (MLK/LCZ) of AAMs either alone or in a combination posing positive role in controlling different post viral manifestations [4] , [5] , [6] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] showing significant safety and efficacy [15] , [16] [17] resulting need to see what happens when alone/combinedly it would be treated as preventive/prophylactic/curative of COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'Free energies of interactions were calculated for several molecular complexes involving the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins. The present theoretical results confirmed that both RBD proteins have similar binding affinity to the ACE2 as previously reported in experimental studies. This is observed at both acid and neutral pH regimes which probably indicates that the medium pH is not so relevant for the beginning of the viral cell invasion. pH seems to be more important for the next steps of the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This has a direct implication for the drug development since the proposal of some like chloroquine is to raise cell pH.',\n",
       " 'Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptorligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'The fact that the renin/angiotensin system ACE and ACE2 is at the center of the discussion is probably due to its potential dual effect in different phases of COVID-19 (Figure) . It should be emphasized that chloroquine has been advocated as a potentially effective drug to be administered in CIVID-19 associated pneumonia [28] . In vitro models showed that inhibitory effects are observed either before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages [29] . Chloroquine acts by elevating the endosomal pH, and interferes with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, thus negatively influencing the SARS virus-receptor binding as indicated in 2005 by in vitro studies [29] . In the early phase of infection with SARS-Cov-2, chloroquine could reduce the binding of the virus to ACE2 on alveolar lung cells membrane and possibly without interfering with ACE2 function. This would result in a reduction of direct viral cytotoxicity without unbalancing the complex equilibrium of the ACE system especially in the setting of ACE2 overexpression. Ongoing randomized trials will answer the question of usefulness of this medication.',\n",

To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively.',\n",

Clazakizumab was available on a compassionate use basis and approved by the FDA and local IRB, following administration of which the patient had significant reduction in inflammatory markers, and was discharged within 6 days of therapy.

Case presentation: Laboratory findings showed high lactic acid level (2.1 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 48.8 mg/L), and low white blood cell count (1.96 × 10 9 /L) in a 65-year-old Chinese man, who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. CP was intravenously given twice, and hydroxychloroquine was orally administrated for a week (0.2 g, three times a day). The lactic acid and C-reactive protein levels remained high (2.1 mmol/L and 73.23 mg/L, respectively), while the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation decreased to 86% with a low oxygenation index (OI, 76 mmHg) on day 4 after CP transfusion. His temperature returned to normal and the OI ascended above 300 on day 11. Moreover, the RNA test remained positive in throat swab, and computed tomography revealed severe pulmonary lesions on day 11 after admission.

Both antiviral therapy and treatment of the systematic response are important for patients with rapid deterioration of COVID-19. In a study with small sample size, the median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days, and the disappearance of viremia was observed in 7 days after CP transfusion [3] . The results suggested that CP therapy could potentially improve the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 [3] . In another study, CP transfusion was given at a median of 21.5 days after first detection of SARS-CoV-2, the viral load became negative 3 days after CP transfusion, though 5 of 6 patients died eventually [5] . Unexpectedly, the viral load remained detectable on day 11 after combination therapy with CP and hydroxychloroquine. Considering the time from onset of illness to CP transfusion in previous studied [3, 5] , it is difficult to prove whether the viremia is cured by the CP and antiviral agent, or is a natural course of COVID-19. Indeed, there is a limitation that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in CP from the two convalescent patients and the present patient are not detected. Based on our clinical experience, sufficient evidence supporting the use of CP and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is lacking.',\n",

In addition to population-based strategies such as social distancing, there are significant ongoing efforts to develop a prophylactic solution (Table S1). As the immunodominant humoral immune response in patients is directed against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein, many vaccines under investigation target this viral protein. It remains to be determined whether anti-spike protein antibodies induced by natural infection or by vaccines induce neutralizing antibody responses.

Artemisinins such as artesunate have lately attracted much attention in the management of COVID-19, owing to their anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, likely attributed to inhibition of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) downregulation and consequent disruption of viral replication in the early phase [15] .',\n",

SARS-CoV-2 is part of the B lineage of beta-coronaviruses, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) [7] . e current outbreak is of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which originated in the Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China and has since spread globally [7] . SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis using the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors in the lungs [8] . SARS-CoV-2 has a wide variety of initial symptoms. Patients can range from asymptomatic infections to only having symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract [9] . Approximately 14% (13.8%, n � 44,672) of patients develop severe disease, which requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and around 5% require intensive care unit management [10] . In patients who become symptomatic, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can consist of fever, nasal congestion, fatigue, cough, and other typical signs of respiratory infections [11] . e symptoms of infected patients usually present within one week [11] . An accurate percentage of infected patients who are asymptomatic has not yet been possible to be assessed [7] . In observational studies to date, the mean incubation period is five days, with a median incubation period of three days [11] (interquartile range 2 to 7). Pneumonia usually occurs around the second to third week in patients who are symptomatic [9] . Notable signs of viral pneumonia are arterial blood gas abnormalities and decreased oxygen saturations, as well as changes seen on imaging [9, 11] . Common abnormities seen on imaging (n � 101) include ground-glass opacities (86.1%), combined ground-glass opacities and consolidation (64.4%), bilateral lung involvement (82.2%), as well as alveolar exudates, and interlobular involvement [4, 9] . Another common finding is leukopenia on complete blood counts (82.1%, n � 1,099) [9, 11] . COVID-19 is considered a mild illness when patients have uncomplicated upper respiratory tract symptoms. Adults who develop pneumonia but have no signs of severe disease (respiratory rates greater than 30 and SpO 2 equal to or less than 93% on room air) do not require oxygen supplementation [12] . Management of patients with mild disease does not require hospitalization. However, isolation Case Reports in Infectious Diseases is mandatory to contain virus transmission [12] . Patients with mild disease should receive symptomatic relief. ey should also be counseled on the potential of developing severe disease and of seeking urgent care in case symptoms worsen. is is also a recommendation for physicians as displayed by this patient who seemingly improved before rapidly declining. Oxygen therapy should be given immediately to patients with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and shock. e target oxygen saturation should be >94% [12] . Patients will need close monitoring for signs of clinical deterioration. Management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is considered when patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If ARDS develops, intubation should be performed. e initial tidal volume ranging between 4 and 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight and lower plateau pressure <30 cm H 2 O are recommended. Prone ventilation is recommended for 12-16 hours per day for patients with severe ARDS [12] . Conservative fluid management is recommended when there is no tissue hypoperfusion. For moderate to severe ADRS, high PEEP and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 less than 150 mmHg should also be used [12] . Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids is not recommended, as a systemic review of observational studies administered to patients with SARS in 2002-2003 reported no survival benefit and possible harms [13] . A recent small French open-label nonrandomized clinical trial showed treating confirmed COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced viral load, and the effect was reinforced by adding azithromycin [14] . However, more recent studies have shown this treatment to be potentially harmful, as it is potentially associated with mortality due to cardiac arrhythmias as an associated adverse event, and thus cardiac monitoring is advised [15, 16] . erefore, the application of such therapy must be carefully considered based on the patient's clinical presentation, as well as the setting in which they are being managed [15, 17] .\",\n",

On the other hand, hundreds of different anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been reported that are capable of terminating SARS-COV-2 viral replication and RNA extension.

To address these problems, we utilized a novel approach by gathering medicinal compounds with antiviral and immunomodulatory activity to check their inhibitory interaction against critical SARS-COV-2 proteins. The viral proteins include structural proteins such as spike glycoprotein that allow these viral particles to attach themselves to ACE-2 receptor of the host cell, whereas nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, NSP-15) facilitate viral replication and proteases modulate the production of different proteins through proteolytic cleavage of SARS-COV-2 polyproteins. This study aimed to obtain novel drug candidates that have the capability to interact with the active site of all of these viral proteins and should possess efficient pharmacokinetic profile with low toxicity to ensure safety during administration. Both proteins and ligands were prepared with Modrefiner and PRODRG server to eradicate any bad contacts, unwanted potential energy and structural anomaly that might result in false interaction. These structurally refined molecules were used and added to raccoon2 virtual screening plugin of Autodock vina to perform virtual screening of these ligands and to filter out possible drug candidates establishing hydrogen bonds, other than Vanderwaal interaction, with the active site residues of these viral protein receptors. Only six medicinal compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone formed hydrogen bonds with these viral proteins. These compounds were further analyzed for ligand RMSD to evaluate their interaction stability through LigRMSD [25] . The predicted value of RMSD of these compounds was in between 0.9-1.5Å, which is considered adequate and stable [30] .\",\n",

       " 'Whilst the currently ongoing multiple trials for IL-6 inhibitors will answer important questions regarding the clinical usefulness of this class of drugs, the number of these studies is still proportionately lower than the clinical trials underway or announced for drugs like hydroxycholorquine. This is despite the fact that most of the recently published data for this drug have not been encouraging. A retrospective analysis of 368 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection in all US Veterans Health Administration medical centers during one month, showed no evidence of benefit with hydroxychloroquine [61] . Similar disappointing results and opposing conclusions have also been obtained in other studies [62, 63] . In fact, safety concerns related to the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 patients had been incited by a recently published large observational analysis, in response to which the WHO temporarily suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity trial while the safety data was reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board; the hydroxycholorquine arm has now been reinstated and the registry analysis retracted since [7, 10] . This overwhelming fascination with hydroxychloroquine until recently has continued across the globe from USA, Europe to China and India, perhaps due to the drug being inexpensive? Currently, remdesivir has been proven to be successful treatment for COVID-19 with the announcement of its encouraging results [9] . But it has to be borne in mind that this is still an investigational agent, with safety and long-term effects being much less explored; the global availability also remains a contentious issue, although the innovator company has entered into collaboration with multiple local manufacturers in key regions of the world.',\n",

       " 'Introduction We present the report of the first, to our best knowledge, case of COVID-19 in a tetraplegic person. Case presentation A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. Discussion Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.',\n",
       " 'Given that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world, we can be generally confident about their safety. Of course, with any therapeutic agent there are always risks of adverse effects, and thus the risks and benefits of treatment as always need to be determined on an individual basis. Risks of treatment with hydroxychloroquine include retinal damage (associated with long term use) and QT prolongation. Hydroxychloroquine is contraindicated in people with a history of hypersensitivity to 4aminoquinoline compounds and should be used with caution in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (10) . Recommended dosing regimens from recent literature, national guidelines, and individual hospital guidelines for COVID-19 have been similar to those currently used for malaria (3, 8) . Given that hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated superior efficacy in vitro for the prevention of infection, it should be considered as a first-line agent against COVID-19 infection over chloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine should be utilized given the low risks associated with treatment and be further explored as a therapeutic agent at a dose of 400 mg orally per day. In addition to larger clinical studies to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in the setting of active infection, of particular interest would be further studies examining the utility of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis against COVID-19 at a weekly dose of 400 mg orally given the long half-life (over 40 days), its previous utility as a prophylactic agent against malaria infections, and promising in vitro results (3, 11) . Despite limited clinical data, Hydroxychloroquine taken at 400 mg orally per day during active infection may offer an avenue of infection control and treatment of affected individuals in a time of rapid need for therapeutic options. Perhaps the answer to this once in a lifetime pandemic can be found from a dependable agent that has been used in the treatment of malaria for several decades and can be found readily throughout the world.',\n",
       " 'The role of prevention cannot be over emphasized especially nosocomial spread through HCPs. The WHO and governments world over are constantly working for development of vaccines. The utility of drugs like hydroxychloroquine and anti-virals is still questionable. As such, strict adherence to barrier precautions and social distancing remains our best bet.',\n",
       " 'The high rate of thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19 seems likely to reflect viral infection of vascular endothelial cells, which express the ACE2 protein that enables SARS-CoV-2 to invade cells. Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation. If this hypothesis is correct, hydroxychloroquine, spirulina (more specifically, its chromophore phycocyanobilin) and high-dose glycine may have practical potential for mitigating the elevated thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19.',\n",
       " \"SARS-CoV-2 is likewise a single-stranded RNA virus, the intracellular uptake of which is mediated by endosomes. 16 We postulated that SARS-CoV-2, after incorporation into endosomes within endothelial cells, can likewise activate endosomal NADPH oxidase via TLR7, and that the resulting local production of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide leads to activation of NF-kappaB-by a mechanism yet to be determined-and subsequently to increased expression of TF. At present, while it is difficult to trace clinical studies that have measured serum markers of oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients, the fact that clinical outcomes were poorer in those provinces of China where soil selenium is deficient is compatible with the view that oxidant stress plays a key pathogenic role in this syndrome, and selenium is required for function of multiple antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases. 17 18 Moreover, oxidative stress is a key feature of other viral diseases that evoke acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytokine storm. 19 tHerAPeutiC imPliCAtions of tHe HyPotHesis This hypothesis is of practical significance because practical measures for inhibiting endosomal NADPH activity may be at hand. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the antimalarial agent now commonly used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, has been shown to decrease the elevated risk for thrombotic complications associated with SLE. 20 21 It has recently been demonstrated that HCQ, likely via its alkalinising effect on endosomes, abrogates the ability of aPL to activate endosomal NOX2dependent NADPH oxidase activity, and this reflects a failure of NOX2 to be translocated into endosomes. 22 The authors further demonstrated that HCQ treatment protects mice from aPL-induced thrombosis. We postulated that HCQ can likewise prevent endosomal NADPH oxidase activation in SARS-CoV-2-exposed endothelial cells, thereby reducing risk for the thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19 infection. This is of particular interest in light of the ability of HCQ to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and of preliminary evidence that administration of HCQ early in the course of COVID-19 may improve therapeutic outcomes, likely by slowing cell-to-cell spread of the virus. 23-25 HCQ-mediated alkalination of endosomes could be expected to suppress the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L, required for endosomally entrapped SARS-CoV-2 virions to escape into the cytoplasm. 16 26 27 In addition, phycocyanobilin (PCB), a biliverdin metabolite prominently expressed as a light-absorbing chromophore in cyanobacteria (such as spirulina) and many blue-green algae, has been found to mimic the ability of its chemical relative unconjugated bilirubin to inhibit NADPH oxidase complexes. 28 29 This likely explains the strong antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects of orally administered spirulina (or of phycocyanin, the spirulina protein to which PCB is covalently attached) in a number of rodent models of heath disorders in which NADPH oxidase activation plays a pathogenic role. 28 30 It is therefore proposed that oral administration of PCB (or of spirulina or of phycocyanin) could help prevent thrombotic complications of COVID-19. Independent considerations suggested that this agent might also be useful for boosting the type 1 interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses and for blunting the cytokine storm that complicates late-stage COVID-19. 31 Theoretical considerations suggested that elevated plasma levels of the amino acid glycine-which is known to have intriguing anti-inflammatory properties-may suppress endosomal activation of NADPH oxidase in cells that express strychnine-inhibitable glycine receptors. 32 Indeed, endothelial cells express such receptors. 33 34 Hence, the impact of supplemental glycine-inexpensive, well-tolerated and pleasantly sweet-on TF expression in endothelial cells exposed to proinflammatory stimuli-including SARS-CoV-2-would be of interest to study. Glycine supplementation might also aid control of thrombotic complications via a direct antiaggregatory effect on platelets mediated by glycine receptors. 35 The upregulatory impact of NADPH oxidase activity on NF-kappaB activation and TF expression is likely mediated by reversible oxidation by hydrogen peroxide of sulfhydryl groups in specific proteins that participate in this activation. 36 37 If so, then boosting synthesis of glutathione and thioredoxin while upregulating the expression of enzymes that work with them to reverse cysteine oxidations (eg, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase) would be expected to counteract the impact of hydrogen peroxide on NF-kappaB activation. 38 Moreover, increasing the expression of glutathione peroxidase would also counteract the signalling impacts of hydrogen peroxide. These benefits could be achieved with clinically useful phase 2 inducer nutraceuticals-such as lipoic acid, ferulic acid or sulforaphane-complemented by supplementation with N-acetylcysteine; the latter supplies cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Glycine supplementation can also promote glutathione synthesis. 47 48 A number of studies have observed that nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity oppose the endothelial induction of TF by various proinflammatory stimuli. The ability of drugs that stimulate or activate soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to replicate this effect suggests that cGMP is the downstream mediator of NO's impact in this regard. 49 Intriguingly, these drugs do not influence the ability of TNFα to suppress protein levels of IkappaB, but nonetheless they do suppress the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB as assessed with a transfected reporter gene. 49 Since the oxidative stress induced by NADPH oxidase activation would seem likely to promote uncoupling of eNOS, agents that correct this uncoupling might be expected to downregulate COVID-19-mediated TF induction. Specifically, supplemental intakes of citrulline and of high-dose folate might be useful in this regard, as these agents counteract the uncoupling induced by asymmetric dimethylarginine and by oxidation of Hydroxychloroquine-200 mg, 2 times per day Spirulina-15 g (rounded tablespoon), one time per day Glycine powder-5 g, 2-3 times per day Lipoic acid-600 mg, 2-3 times per day Ferulic acid-500 mg, 2 times per day Broccoli sprout powder-5 g, 1-2 times per day (providing 20-40 mg of sulforaphane) N-acetylcysteine-600 mg, 2-3 times per day Citrulline powder-2 g, 2 times per day Folic acid-40 mg, one time per day Biotin-10 mg, 2-3 times per day tetrahydrobiopterin, respectively. [50] [51] [52] [53] Alternatively, agents that directly stimulate or activate sGC might also be useful for suppressing TF induction; in addition to pharmaceuticals that have this effect, supraphysiological concentrations of biotin can stimulate sGC activity. 54 55 Measures that quell endothelial oxidative stress while supporting effective eNOS activity might not only help to control the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, but also be expected to blunt the exuberant influx of neutrophils that promote respiratory distress in this syndrome. Nitric oxide, by both cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent mechanism, inhibits endothelial expression of adhesion factors for neutrophils whereas oxidants upregulate such expression. [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] Box 1 proposes dose schedules for the drugs/nutraceuticals cited earlier that might have practical potential for reducing the thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19. These suggestions deal with agents that might impact the endothelial activation associated with COVID-19. Evidently, drugs that address overactive coagulation or platelet activation may also have potential for controlling the thrombotic complications of this syndrome; in that regard, many physicians are currently employing heparin injections. 68 69 limitAtions This essay proposes a hypothesis that, in the authors' opinion, is credible and, if true, it should help to explain the common thromboembolic complications of COVID-19, while also suggesting practical measures that could lessen the thrombogenicity of vascular endothelium infected by the virus, or exposed to proinflammatory cytokines released in response to viral infection. It is intended to stimulate preclinical study of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and vascular endothelial cells which could be useful for affirming or disproving the hypothesis. This hypothesis should not be considered to be proven, and the suggestions it provides regarding drugs or nutraceuticals which might ameliorate vascular dysfunction during COVID-19 should not be considered as prescriptive.\",\n",

Only four cases of spontaneous miscarriage or abortion were reported. In the 219 cases that were delivered, including two with twin pregnancy, the majority had a Cesarean section. The gestational age at delivery ranged from 28 to 41 weeks. The Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes ranged from 7 to 10 and 7 to 10, respectively (Table 5a ). Only eight neonates had birth weight < 2500 g. Nearly one-third of the neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), mainly due to the need of investigations and monitoring as a result of maternal infection. There was one case each of neonatal asphyxia and neonatal death in the consecutive case series.

She was started on azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, vancomycin, and oseltamivir. The patient underwent a preterm Cesarean delivery due to compromised respiratory status. Neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact.

Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus.',\n",
       " 'The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has quickly become a threat to the public health and economy worldwide [7, 27] . Recent clinical reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 causes mild, selflimiting respiratory tract illness as well as severe progressive pneumonia, which can progress to multiorgan failure and death [1] . Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat this disease [1] . Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs [1] . After the analysis of the selected studies, we identified 57 molecules with potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Of these, only six drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir (arbidol), remdesivir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine) have shown promising results in preclinical trials and have clinically lessened the symptoms of COVID-19. Since the other FDA-approved drugs reported in this review showed weak activity against COVID-19, we have chosen to discuss only the most promising molecules.',\n",
       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents widely used to treat rheumatic diseases and have also shown promising activity against COVID-19 [36] . The first evidence of their antiviral effect against coronavirus was reported in 2004 when Keyaerts and collaborators showed that chloroquine inhibited the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV on Vero cells E6. In this study, chloroquine negatively affected SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 8 μM [37] . Interestingly, chloroquine inhibited the virus when the cells were treated with the drug before or after exposure to SARS-CoV, suggesting prophylactic and therapeutic effects [38] . This drug also affects the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, with an EC 50 of 1.13 μM [18] . Moreover, hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is also able to inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 with an EC 50 of 4.51 μM ( Table 2 ) [19] . Additionally, the preclinical results have suggested that this antimalarial blocks the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from endosomes to endolysosomes, which is a process required to release the viral genome [18, 19] .',\n",
       " 'The promising in vitro results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have motivated the initiation of clinical studies of these substances ( Table 4) . One of these studies evaluates the prophylactic effect of the oral use of chloroquine in 10,000 patients against SARS-CoV-2 (Clinicaltrial. gov, NCT04303507). Additionally, several clinical trials have evaluated the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine (Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT04318015, and NCT04318444), its therapeutic use in monotherapy (Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT04315896), or the effect of its combination with other antivirals (Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT04303299, NCT04321278 and NCT0430127, and NCT0430127 and NCT0430127) against COVID-19.',\n",
       " 'The rapid popularization of these preliminary results has led to a massive and irrational demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In Brazil, for example, after the first reports of the clinical effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, this drug quickly sold out in pharmacies, which has compromised patients who use this drug continually to treat autoimmune diseases. This irrational demand caused the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) to include these two drugs in the list of controlled substances to prevent their use to treat COVID-19 without prescription or proof of effectiveness. This situation highlights the importance of controlling the release of preliminary results, especially in the panic scenario created by the pandemic.',\n",
       " 'The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has put pressure on research centers to develop effective therapies and vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Drug repositioning is a promising short-term strategy in the fight against the novel coronavirus. However, supportive measures are essential mainly for severe COVID-19 patients, and the implementation of drug repositioning should be done only if the efficacy of the drugs have been proven. Although lopinavir/ ritonavir had low anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, arbidol, remdesivir, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine showed promising effects against this coronavirus. Therefore, the outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate the best treatment options for COVID-19. Furthermore, additional studies of the antiviral activity of molecules that have shown a promising in silico effect may increase the therapeutic arsenal against the novel coronavirus.',\n",
       " 'Further research is of the utmost importance to assess the impact of antivirals, chloroquine and other interventions on patient outcomes. Additionally, it is essential to determine the accuracy of available diagnostic tests. Understanding the role of different biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes, and whether they could be used in association with validated scores, such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, to help the decision of choosing patients for scarce intensive care unit beds would be very useful.',\n",
       " 'The novel coronavirus disease, named emerged in China in December 2019, and has rapidly spread around the world. It is clearly urgent to fight COVID-19 at global scale. The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community. And Clomiphene in the same community inibited the entry of Ebola Virus, indicated a similar MoAs that could be reflected by cell image.',\n",
       " 'It is found that the currently effective drugs for COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, although not the same on the MoAs label, have similar drug characteristics. On the one hand, they can inhibit T cell proliferation and reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which can increase the pH of endosome and block endocytosis. They can all appear in category 21. This result indicates that their common mechanism is related to the DIP after they act on the cells. The other drugs in antagonist, which has been found to be resistant to Ebola, suggesting that it may have a similar mechanism of action. This research work laid the foundation for the discovery of a new drug mechanism based on image data, and at the same time provided a new method for COVID19 drug relocation. In the next step, we will conduct antiviral screening experiments on some new predicted drugs.',\n",
       " 'The widespread coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 4 million people worldwide, with a death toll over 280,000. Current treatment of COVID-19 patients relies mainly on antiviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and remdesivir, the anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and traditional Chinese medicine. There are over 2,118 on-going clinical trials underway, but to date none of these drugs have consistently proven effective. Cathepsin L (CatL) is an endosomal cysteine protease. It mediates the cleavage of the S1 subunit of the coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein. This cleavage is necessary for coronavirus entry into human host cells, virus and host cell endosome membrane fusion, and viral RNA release for next round of replication. Here we summarize data regarding seven CatL-selective inhibitors that block coronavirus entry into cultured host cells and provide a mechanism to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Given the rapid growth of the SARS-CoV-2-positive population worldwide, ready-to-use CatL inhibitors should be explored as a treatment option. We identify ten US FDA-approved drugs that have CatL inhibitory activity. We provide evidence that supports the combined use of serine protease and CatL inhibitors as a possibly safer and more effective therapy than other available therapeutics to block coronavirus host cell entry and intracellular replication, without compromising the immune system.',\n",
       " 'The worldwide and severe COVID-19 pandemic calls for treatments before and even after vaccines become available. This article highlights the importance of CatL in coronavirus infection, particularly SARS-CoV-2, and proposes a hypothesis for treament of COVID-19 by targeting CatL activity. This publication also aims to bring to light existing CatL inhibitor compounds, particularly FDA-approved drugs, that may potentiate treatments for the current COVID-19 pandemic. These FDA-approved CatL inhibitory drugs provide a COVID-19 antiviral therapy that may be appropriate for patients depending on their current medical conditions, especially for those newly exposed to the virus or who test positive for the virus but are asymptomatic, when the early infection may be more clinically manageable. Therapeutic applications of CatL inhibitors, including some currently FDA-approved, employed alone or more preferably together with the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, may emerge from both basic and clinical studies to as proving value in COVID-19 treatment. As camostat mesylate has broad use among chronic pancreatitis patients, and a number of drugs that can inhibit CatL already have FDA approvals, we advocate testing of this protease inhibitor cocktail approach for management of COVID-19 patients. We also point out how chloroquine and analogs may impair the human adaptive immune system ability to fight virus infection. In contrast, the proposed protease inhibitor cocktail approach may both inhibit virus infection and activate adaptive immunity. We advocate testing the combined inhibition of CatL and the serine protease TMPRSS2 as a novel treatment for COVID-19 patients.',\n",
       " 'Finally we propose, that the developed computational model effectively identifies Human-nCoV PPIs with high specificity. nCoV-Human interactions are inferred from another pandemic initiator SARS-CoV which is believed to be highly genetically similar to nCoV. We also identify the human spreader proteins (up to level-2) using spreadability index, validated through SIS model. Due to high network density in human interaction network, number of proteins increase with the transition from one level to another. So, our proposed model is also capable of identifying human spreader proteins in level-2 by using spreadability index which is validated by SIS model. Target proteins of the potential FDA drugs for COVID-19 are found to overlap with the spreader nodes of the proposed computational nCoV-Human protein interaction model. Target proteins of seven potential FDA drugs: Lopinavir 30 , Ritonavir 31 , Hydroxychloroquine 32, 33 , Azithromycin 33 , Remdesivir 34-36 , Favipiravir 37, 38 and Darunavir 39 for COVID-19 as mentioned in the DrugBank white paper 26 overlap with the spreader nodes of the proposed in silico nCoV-Human protein interaction model (see Figure 5 ). Though clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in 2020 are on their way till date but three out of the seven i.e. Remdesivir 46 Hydroxychloroquine 47 and Favipiravir 47 are found to be the most promising as well as effective ones and their protein targets R1AB_SARS2, TLR9, ACE2, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 are also successfully identified as spreader nodes by our proposed model. This assessment reveals the fact that these spreader nodes are indeed have biological relevance relative to disease propagation.',\n",
       " 'Dr Uriel: In this case, a patient with underlying cardiac disease developed profound decompensation in the context of COVID-19 infection, characterized by a recurrence of a reduced LVEF accompanied by cardiogenic shock and proclivity for tachyarrhythmias. Neither myocarditis nor cytokine storm were probable mediators of the recurrence of her depressed cardiac function, given the relatively low biomarker levels. Whether patients with recovered systolic function will be at similar risk for this recrudescence of reduced LVEF awaits further study. Because of tachyarrhythmias, management of the cardiogenic component of her shock with inotropic agents was not feasible. However, early intubation and reversal of her respiratory failure led to improvements in hemodynamics in the absence of direct cardiac support. This case also highlights the need for rapid correction of hypoxemia in patients with an underlying heart failure, and the usefulness of pulmonary artery catheterization when shock is thought to be multifactorial. In patients with a coexisting cardiomyopathy, baseline QT prolongation may impact consideration of use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.',\n",
       " 'All HD patients with COVID-19 were treated with anti-viral therapy, hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics (azithromycin) and low molecular weight heparin and there were no statistically significant differences in age, dialysis vintage, major comorbidities between the COVID-19 patients who died and the COVID-19 patients who were discharged or still hospitalized. A factor explaining such high mortality may be the mean age of the HD patients in our HD centres, however the high mortality among HD patients indicates a vulnerability towards a severe viral infection.',\n",
       " 'Antimalarial drugs have been reported to effectively block several viral infections 67 , including SARS-CoV-2 26 . However, the activities of many of these, in particular chloroquine derivatives, have not been recapitulated in clinical trials 17, 18 . Drugs belonging to this class are generally reported to be less effective in blocking viral infections compared to their anti-malarial activity, with EC 50 generally in a µM range 67 .',\n",
       " 'The question to be answered is whether a therapy that uses Everolimus in COVID-19 could reduce the pathophysiological hyperactivation of the immune response in the lung and other organs described as extensively degenerated by inflammation upon infection with this coronavirus Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020) . It is certainly a gamble to administer a potentially immunosuppressive drug in a viral infection, and therefore Everolimus should probably be used at doses close to those used in anti-tumor therapy to avoid adverse effects dependent on the immune-depression emerging at higher doses. As referred to in the previous paragraph, Everolimus may inhibit conventional T lymphocytes and may maintain Treg functions to reduce hyper-reactivity in COVID-19 ( Figure 1) . However, Everolimus could be administered together with current therapeutic approaches, particularly in the critical phase of SARS-Cov2 infection (Askanase et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020) . Indeed, since hyper-reactivity is one of the determinants of COVID-19 critical phase, Everolimus could be utilized for the same rational use as Tocilizumab, Hydrochloroquine, Heparin, and Steroids in the intensive therapy of COVID-19 (Askanase et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020; Piva et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020; Radbel et al., 2020; Whyte et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Yuki et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020) . Moreover, the putative anti-replicative effect of Everolimus in controlling viral spread could also be promising in SARS-CoV2 infection (Figure 1 ) on the basis of its ability to reduce mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and viral replication (Dunlop and Tee, 2009; Laplante and Sabatini, 2009; Dowling et al., 2010; Garofalo et al., 2019; Nanmoku et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2019) . FIGURE 1 | The hypothesis of a therapy using mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus) in COVID-19. The critical phases of COVID-19 show pathophysiological aspects resembling a sort of immune response hypersensitivity, mediated by exacerbated immune mechanism and cytokine storm. mTOR inhibition (i.e., by Everolimus) could act in reducing SARS-CoV2 replication (A), in inhibiting the cytokine storm dependent on the hyper-activated-STAT3 pathway (B), in contrasting Treg downregulation, and in reducing conventional hyper-reactive T cells (C) in COVID-19. Current step-use of Tocilizumab, Hydrochloroquine, Heparin, and Steroids is reported in the figure.',\n",
       " 'The second major thrust of our study was to understand how potential therapeutics, being actively considered for widespread prophylactic and therapeutic intervention would affect virus-receptor interaction. Considering that an earlier report for SARS-CoV had suggested the possibility of such modulation (Martin JV, et al., 2005) , we expanded our analysis to include active metabolites of these drugs. The drugs/metabolites evaluated were Azithromycin, Descladinose-azithromycin, 9a-N-desmethyl-azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, Desethyl chloroquine, Desethyl hydroxychloroquine, and bis desethyl hydroxychloroquine (BDCQ). We report for the first time that each of these compounds have the potential to allosterically modulate S1-ACE2 binding when studied using a protein-ligand approach. HCQ and its metabolites with the exception of BDCQ showed lower affinity and higher inhibitory constants compared to those of Azithromycin. Significantly, metabolites in general showed similar binding affinity compared to their respective parent compounds. In fact, in the case of Hydroxychloroquine, BDCQ showed almost 30-fold better binding to ACE2 and this affinity was similar to that observed for Azithromycin. The lack of sequence information both globally and especially from India (Forster P, et al., 2020; Yadav P, et al., 2020) has limited our ability to robustly examine true consensus sequences for our analysis. Also, our insights need to be experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results highlight a putative role of S1-sACE2 complexes in viral pathogenesis in susceptible populations. Further, we posit a direct role for ACE2 interacting drugs and other lead compounds (Goswami D, et al., 2020) in preventing infection, ameliorating viral carriage and eventually affecting transmission.',\n",

With the number of patients increasing daily, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " 'The results of this study demonstrate that in a strictly monitored protocol-driven inhospital setting, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In this study, among one of the largest COVID-19 hospital patient cohorts (n=2,541) assembled in a single institution, overall in-hospital COVID-19 associated mortality was 18.1% reflecting a high prevalence of co-morbid conditions in COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution. The independent predictors of mortality in our study included age ≥ 65 years, CKD, and severe illness at initial presentation as measured by the oxygen saturation levels on admission, and ventilator use reflect findings similar to those reported in earlier studies. 29 These predictors also underscore the high-risk for COVID-19 experienced by residents in our hospital catchment population in Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan. Michigan is among the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f states with the highest number of cases of COVID-19 and deaths. In Detroit, our residents suffer from substantial preexisting social and racial health disparities that place our patients at increased risk of severe disease and higher mortality. 1 In the present study, multivariate analysis performed using Cox regression modeling and propensity score matching to control for potential confounders affirmed that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin was associated with higher survival among patients with COVID-19. Patients that received neither medication or azithromycin alone had the highest cumulative hazard. The benefits of hydroxychloroquine in our cohort as compared to previous studies maybe related to its use early in the disease course with standardized, and safe dosing, inclusion criteria, comorbidities, or larger cohort. The postulated pathophysiology of COVID-19 of the initial viral infection phase followed by the hyperimmune response suggest potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine for its antiviral and antithrombotic properties. Later therapy in patients that have already experienced hyperimmune response or critical illness is less likely to be of benefit.',\n",
       " 'Others have shown that COVID-19 hospitalized patients are not diagnosed in the community and often rapidly deteriorate when hospitalized with fulminant illness. 30 Limitations to our analysis include the retrospective, non-randomized, non-blinded study design. Also, information on duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was not available for analysis. However, our study is notable for use of a cohort of consecutive patients from a multihospital institution, regularly updated and standardized institutional clinical treatment guidelines and a QTc interval-based algorithm specifically designed to ensure the safe use of hydroxychloroquine. To mitigate potential limitations associated with missing or inaccurate documentation in electronic medical records, we manually reviewed all deaths to confirm the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f primary mortality outcome and ascertain the cause of death. A review of our COVID-19 mortality data demonstrated no major cardiac arrhythmias; specifically, no torsades de pointes that has been observed with hydroxychloroquine treatment. This finding may be explained in two ways. First, our patient population received aggressive early medical intervention, and were less prone to development of myocarditis, and cardiac inflammation commonly seen in later stages of COVID-19 disease. Second, and importantly, inpatient telemetry with established electrolyte protocols were stringently applied to our population and monitoring for cardiac dysrhythmias was effective in controlling for adverse events. Additional strengths were the inclusion of a multi-racial patient composition, confirmation of all patients for infection with PCR, and control for various confounding factors including patient characteristics such as severity of illness by propensity matching.',\n",
       " 'Recent observational retrospective studies and randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine have reported variable results. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In a randomized controlled study of 62 patients from China with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a shortened duration of fever and time to cough and pneumonia resolution. 17 In contrast, a study of 1376 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York that used respiratory failure as the primary endpoint found no significant reduction in the likelihood of death or intubation among those receiving hydroxychloroquine compared to those who did not. 19 In a separate multicenter cohort study of 1438 patients from 25 hospitals in New York, no reduction in hospitalized patient mortality was observed with hydroxychloroquine treatment. 20 Among a number of limitations, this study included patients who were initiated on hydroxychloroquine therapy at any time during their hospitalization. In contrast, in our patient population, 82% received hydroxychloroquine within the first 24 hours of admission, and 91% within 48 hours of admission. Because treatment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f regimens likely varied substantially (including delayed initiation) across the 25 hospitals that contributed patients to the study, it is not surprising that the case-fatality rate among the New York patients was significantly higher than in our study.',\n",

These findings do support the recent NIH guidelines 24 , indicating a potential role for hydroxychloroquine in treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients without co-administration of azithromycin. However, our results should be interpreted with some caution and should not be applied to patients treated outside of hospital settings. Our results also require further confirmation in prospective, randomized controlled trials that rigorously evaluate the safety, and ',\n",

During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac',\n",
       " 'Background: While several trials are ongoing for treatment of COVID-19, scientific research on chemoprophylaxis is still lacking even though it has potential to delay the pandemic allowing us time to complete research on vaccines. Methods: We have conducted a cohort study amongst Health Care Workers (HCW) exposed to COVID-19 patients, at a tertiary care center in India where there was an abrupt cluster outbreak within on duty personnel. HCWs who had voluntarily taken hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to exposure were considered one cohort while those who had not were considered to be another. All participants with a verifiable contact history were tested for COVID-19 by rtPCR. The two cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, comorbidities and exposure. The primary outcome was incidence rates of rtPCR positive COVID-19 infection amongst HCQ users and nonusers. Results: 106 healthcare workers were examined in this cohort study of whom 54 were HCQ users and rest were not. The comparative analysis of incidence of infection between the two groups demonstrated that voluntary HCQ usage was associated with lesser likelihood of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it, X2=14.59, p<0.001. None of the HCQ users noted any serious adverse effects. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that voluntary HCQ consumption as pre-exposure prophylaxis by HCWs is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2. These promising findings therefore highlight the need to examine this association in greater detail among a larger sample using Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT).',\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare systems across the world in crisis with significant social and economic burden on countries. A number of clinical trials (27) are underway to test the efficacy of several repurposed drugs including chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), ivermectin, remdesivir, ritonavir/lopinavir for treatment of COVID-19. None have so far shown exceptional results. (28),(29),(30) . Of these, although HCQ has gathered particular worldwide attention based on in vitro results that demonstrate efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, there is now mounting evidence that HCQ does not offer any significant additional clinical benefit for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and may even be harmful (31) when used in conjunction with antibiotics such as azithromycin.',\n",
       " 'The current cohort study therefore aimed to investigate if hydroxychloroquine could be effective as a pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 among high risk individuals such as healthcare workers. This results from this study, has demonstrated that voluntary consumption of HCQ as prophylaxis among high risk individuals was associated with a significantly reduced risk of testing positive for COVID19 as compared to individuals who did not volunteer to take HCQ X2=14.59, p<0.001. To minimize confounding factors, both the cohorts were balanced in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, type and degree of exposure. Incidentally, one COVID-19 positive participant who was a long-term user of HCQ for Rheumatoid Arthritis, reported discontinuing the drug 1 month prior to exposure. It was also observed that among HCQ takers exposed to a symptomatic contact, only 9.38% were positive whereas among non HCQ takers exposed to a symptomatic contact, 54.55% tested to be positive. Similarly, it was seen that proportions of those testing to be positive were less in HCQ takers among those having a face to face contact, direct contact and environmental contact. Those who used recommended (36) personal protective equipment (PPE), even among them, HCQ takers had a lesser proportion of positive cases (7.69%) than those not taking HCQ prophylaxis(34.78%). These observations need to be further analyzed by future studies. (Table 3 ).The current study also validated the known safety profile for HCQ with no serious adverse events reported by the participants. This promising data represents the first clinical evidence on the potential role of a chemoprophylactic agent.',\n",

       " 'Despite all the beneficial effects described above, it is also important to pay attention to the potential adverse cardiovascular effects of these drugs. For tocilizumab, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are both common adverse events, prompting concern about increased cardiovascular risk (76) . Especially, tocilizumab was widely noted to induce a proatherogenic lipid profile with increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol (77) (78) (79) . However, these changes can be improved by concomitant therapy with statins (80) . For TNF inhibitor (TNFi), although not universally acknowledged, it might not be beneficial to HF. Severe HF remains a contraindication to TNFi treatment in RA patients. A clinical trial showed that high-dose infliximab could be harmful to patients with moderate-to-severe HF (81) . For RA populations, a cohort study found that TNFi might increase the risk of both first hospitalization and exacerbation of HF in elderly patients with RA (82) . Additionally, for hydroxychloroquine, a recent study pointed out that hydroxychloroquine could lead to unwanted QT interval prolongation by blocking the KCNH2encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death (83) . Therefore, biochemical indicators, hemodynamic parameters, and cardiac electrophysiology profiles should be monitored in clinical practice to avoid drug-induced adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac function, or lethal arrhythmias. Besides, corresponding treatment, such as lipidlowering or antihypertensive medications should be prescribed if necessary.',\n",
       " 'At this point, clinical studies are needed expeditiously to investigate the safety and efficacy of local prophylactic regimens following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For instance, investigations can include initial local delivery of a combination of chloroquine, zinc and azithromycin to the eyelids and ocular surface with eye drops or a spray/aerosol. This would potentially inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the likely major entry point into the human body, would reduce the risk of systemic side effects and conserve drugs that may become scarce, since the dosage required would be much less than for systemic treatment. A spray or aerosol preparation would also allow treatment of the nasal passages (45) and mouth (109), given high ACE2 receptor populations in these locations. However, if the virus is truly oculotropic, this may be superfluous. If a patient has active infection of the respiratory tree, then this combined medication could also be given in an inhaled form. The advantage of this ACE2 targeting approach is that ACE2 receptors from the outer cornea, through the lacrimal drainage system to the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems as well as both nasal and oral cavities, are directly accessible to a high topical drug dose. Thus, the portals that make us susceptible to coronavirus attack and invasion can be used to provide protection that is likely to be safe, extensive, convenient and at low cost. The ocular surface, offering all of the benefits of local treatment familiar to ophthalmologists, may thus provide a convenient testing ground for rapid, safe and likely cost-effective trials of newer drugs that may be developed to combat this modern plague.

       " 'In this study, we investigated reports of neuropsychiatric AEs that were developed following exposure to chloroquine as a treatment for malaria or autoimmune diseases. The major strength of our study is that it was based on a database that includes global real-world data from a very large number of patients. Our results showed a statistically significant association (albeit marginal) between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of LOC, amnesia, delirium, hallucination, and depression, however, there was no statistically significant association between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of suicide, psychosis, confusion, or agitation, suggesting that there is no link between the use of chloroquine and the increased risk of these AEs. Conversely, mefloquine showed to be associated with statistically significant high reporting of most of the neuropsychiatric AEs, which is consistent with some of the earlier literature reports [12, 19] .',\n",

       " 'The patients with rheumatic immune diseases have immune dysfunction and may be more susceptible to contract the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and swiftly deteriorate into a severe type [5] . In this case report, we present 5 cases of COVID-19 with concomitant presence of rheumatic immune diseases, thus accounting for 0.88% of the total confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in our hospital, which may underestimate the incidence of rheumatic diseases in patients with COVID-19. It may be related to the omission on the part of the medical staff during the process of history taking. Various studies have reported that the overall incidence rate of COVID-19 is higher in males than in females (58.1% vs 41.9%) [6] , which may be related to differences in innate immunity and sex hormones. However, in this case report, 4 patients were female, accounting for 80% of the cases and this may be related to the high incidence of RA in females. Amongst the five patients, the severity of COVID-19 was mild and severe in two patients each, and critical in one patient. Thus, the proportion of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was 60%, and two of them were complicated by the baseline pulmonary diseases. One of the RA patients was treated with Methotrexate during the entire period of hospitalization, and her condition remained stable. According to a study, coadministration of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine did not result in an increased risk of hospitalization due to infection [7] . In the present report, a 79-year-old male patient with SSc progressed to critical COVID-19, and this may be explained by The texture of both lungs is disordered, the transparency is increased, some of them have reticular changes, multiple patchy ground glass density shadow and fuzzy edge are seen in both lungs. c, d 18 days after the symptom onset: Similar findings as a and b, however, with a few patchy and thin shadows, which are significantly smaller than the previous old age, low immune function, corticosteroid therapy, and concomitant presence of baseline diseases [8, 9] . Prior to the hospitalization, this patient was not diagnosed as a case of interstitial pneumonia. However, during hospitalization, his repeated chest CT examination revealed the change of grid shadow, thus suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. This may be related to the alveolar injury that occur in patients with severe or critical COVID-19, or SSc with prior interstitial pneumonia [10] . While, the other two RA patients, who had discontinued their medication, progressed to severe COVID-19. This suggests that drug withdrawal may be a risk factor for disease progression, if the disease has not been stable over a long period.',\n",
       " 'Various studies have reported that the patients with severe COVID-19 have immune dysfunction, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased levels of cytokines [11] , which are consistent with our findings. Amongst the 5 patients, the levels of IL-6 were raised in severe (n = 2) and critically ill (n = 1) patients. Similarly, the levels of IL-10 were raised in severe (n = 1) and critically ill (n = 1) patients. In these patients, we prescribed Thymosin (IM, 10 mg/day) to enhance immunity and Hydroxychloroquine (PO, 400 mg/day) to regulate the immunity [12] . These treatments were used for the management of inflammatory storm and immune regulation in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Moreover, biological agents such as IL-6 blocker (IVIg, 400 mg) and plasma exchange (400 ml, one or two times) were used in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients.',\n",
       " 'Our patient presented in this case received treatment with vitamin C and zinc, both of which are known to improve the human immune system and aid in shortening the duration of and improving outcomes in respiratory infections including pneumonia. [8, 9] In addition to vitamin and mineral supplements, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have obtained a large amount of attention for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, a well-known antimalarial and auto-immune medication, is relatively inexpensive and has been extensively studied in the treatment for COVID-19. Studies have suggested hydroxychloroquine can interfere with glycosylation of the coronavirus receptors and increase endosomal pH thus inhibiting viral fusion and decreasing viral load. [10, 11] Gautret et al reported a synergistic effect using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in viral elimination and decreasing viral load. [12] Despite this evidence, the use of hydroxychloroquine for viral infections has been questioned. Roques et al reported a study using chloroquine in Chikungunya virus reporting cytokines were reduced causing the adaptive immune response to be delayed, exacerbating fever, and unchanged suppression of viral load. [13] While further studies are in need to provide concrete evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine, clinical trials from China have already shown promising results for COVID-19 and several countries around the world have begun using these medications. Tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been extensively used in auto-immune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. [14] With this monoclonal antibody, interleukin-6 function is blocked and hence the differentiation of T helper cells and B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells are inhibited. [14] The cytokine storm observed in patients with COVID-19 has been difficult to control and manage leading to increased mortality, tocilizumab therefore helps decrease the immune response and the resulting damage caused by cytokines. [6, 15] While still not approved in the United States, tocilizumab has thus far shown promising results in clinical trials. [15] Other treatments for COVID-19 have also emerged and have thus far shown promising results in ongoing clinical trials. Of these, remdesivir (GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) have become the center of attention. Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that incorporates into viral RNA causing premature termination. [10, 14] It has been found effective at inhibiting viral replication in Ebola, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. [10, 16, 17] Favipiravir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, has already obtained approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in China on February 15th, 2020. [18] Studies have shown favipiravir inhibited RNA polymerase activity and thus prevented replication of RNA viruses like COVID-19 with minimal side effects. [18] Remdesivir (GS-5734, Gilead Sciences Inc.) is currently under several clinical trials and all of its side effects have not yet been defined. In our patient, within 2 days of starting remdesivir our patient had worsening renal function eventually requiring CVVHD and vasopressors thus preventing further treatment with the medication. While our patient was critically ill in the ICU, it is not known if this medication was the cause for further decompensation due to kidney injury. Further studies and clinical trials are required to fully understand the role of remdesivir and other medications in COVID-19 infected patients.',\n",
       " 'COVID-19 is characterized by quantitative and functional abnormalities in lymphocyte populations, in connection with immune hyperactivation and adverse outcomes. Both polyclonal and monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia has been associated to a large spectrum of acute and chronic disorders, including viral infections. We report two cases of transient monoclonal gamma-globulin spike in patients with severe COVID-19. Transient dysregulated antibody production in the acute phase may result from massive IL-6 release during the cytokine storm release in combination with loss of T cellmediated suppression. More data are needed to evaluate the exact frequency, clinical significance, and long-term evolution of monoclonal gammopathy in COVID-19. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Even though SPEP was not systematically incorporated for COVID-19 evaluation at our Department, we observed similar findings in another 80-years old patient with COVID-19 related pneumoniae who had a severe course of disease (Figure, case 2). He was admitted to our COVID Unit because of fever and non-productive cough. Bilateral patchy consolidations were seen on HRCT. His medical history included arterial hypertension, hypothyroidism and previous carotid thromboendarterectomy. No monoclonal spikes were observed in a past SPEP. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir/cobicistat and antibiotics was given but his respiratory status continued to deteriorate. High-flow oxygen was administered through a non-rebreather face mask and steroid treatment was started. At D8, there was severe lymphopenia (250 µL -1 ), increased LDH (529 UI/L), ferritin (959 ng/mL), fibrinogen (797 mg/dL), and CRP (17.9 mg/dL). Platelet count and prothrombin time were within the normal range, whereas D-dimer was markedly increased (14,794 ng/mL) without clinical or echographic evidence of venous thromboembolism. An IgG-kappa monoclonal band was found in his SPEP. The subsequent clinical course was favorable, allowing a gradual reduction in oxygen therapy and steroid tapering. The monoclonal component was significantly decreased in a repeated SPEP at D26, together with normalization of lymphocyte count, ferritin and CRP. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued at D17 and the patient was discharged after 13 days.',\n",
       " 'The objective of this present study is to focus on the in silico study to screen for an alternative drug that can block the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic target of the COVID-19 virus using natural compounds (Isothymol, Thymol, Limonene, P-cymene and c-terpinene) derived from the essential oil of the antiviral and antimicrobial plant Ammoides verticillata (Desf.) Briq. which is located in the occidental Algeria areas. This study reveals that Isothymol, a major component of this plant, gives the best docking scores, compared to, the co-crystallized inhibitor b-D-mannose of the enzyme ACE2, to Captropil drug as good ACE2 inhibitor and to Chloroquine antiviral drug also involved in other mechanisms as inhibition of ACE2 cellular receptor.

Also the other natural compounds gave good results. The Molecular Dynamics Simulation study showed good result for the Isotymol-ACE2 docked complex. This study revealed for the first time that Isothymol is a functional inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity and the components of essential oils Ammoides verticillata can be used as potential inhibitors to the ACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2.',\n",
       " 'This report has limitations that must be considered. Our perspective comes from a single patient treated with remdesivir late in the course of disease. This patient also received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for 5 days, and although he did not initially show clinical improvement after the duration of these therapies, this combination is also being investigated as potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2. 17 It is possible these medications may have impacted his clinical course. He is also a younger patient with few comorbidities. His most significant risk factor for mortality was obesity; because the mortality rate in his demographic in the United States is less than 1%, it is possible that he would have improved without remdesivir. 18, 19 Further study and clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir are required to confirm its efficacy against COVID-19 including if efficacy differences exist between early and delayed administration.',\n",
       " 'The detection of viral nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples is the main method for the diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be combined with epidemiology and imaging to improve the accuracy 5 . The treatment principle of the disease is, on the basis of symptomatic treatment, to actively prevent and cure complications, to prevent secondary infection, and to provide timely organ function support 5 . There are no specific drugs for this infected disease, while some antiviral drugs that may be effective are recommended in China, such as interferon-alpha, lopiravir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate and abidor 5 In this study, we collected a cohort of 85 patients with viral RNA-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of male to female was 45:40, indicating that men and women are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However compared with female patients, male patients accounted for a higher proportion of severe and critical cases. Older patients were at higher risk for disease progression. In addition, clinical data suggested that severe and critical patients often incorporated more basic diseases, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease. This suggests that COVID-19 patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease may require ICU care later. Chest CT before admission suggested that COVID-19 patients with bilateral involvement or multiple lobes involvement were more likely to deteriorate to severe pneumonia. We observed greater increase in NEU count, PCT level, CRP level and greater decrease in lymphocyte count in critically ill patients. This suggests that disease progression in covid-19 patients may be associated with bacterial infection and impaired cellular immunity. In addition, AST was significantly increased and albumin levels were significantly reduced in severe and critical patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 virus may damage liver cells and impair the synthesis function of the liver. Logistic regression analysis showed that NEU is a independent risk factor for deterioration, with the threshold of 6.5×10 9 ·L -1 , suggesting that combination of bacterial infections may be the most important factor in worsening the condition.',\n",
       " 'There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery. Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m 2 . Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.',\n",

       " 'We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration. Methods: We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.',\n",
       " \"COVID-19 poses two major challenges to physicians. The first is the therapeutic management of patients. In this context, it is necessary to avoid a worsening evolution, which usually occurs around the tenth day and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prognosis of which, in particular in the elderly, is poor, whatever the cause. Therefore, the primary therapeutic objective is to treat people who have moderate or severe infections at an early enough stage to avoid progression to a serious and irreversible condition. By administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, we were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible. For all other patients in this cohort of 80 people, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a clinical improvement that appeared superior when compared to outcomes of other hospitalised patients, as described in the literature. In a cohort of 191 Chinese inpatients, of whom 95% received antibiotics and 21% received a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, the median duration of fever was 12 days and that of cough 19 days in survivors, with a 28% case-fatality rate [19] . The favourable evolution of our patients under hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin paralleled a relatively rapid decrease in viral RNA load as assessed by PCR, which was even more rapid when assessed by culture. These data are important to compare with that of the literature which shows that the viral RNA load can remain high for about three weeks in most patients in the absence of specific treatment [19, 23] with extreme cases lasting for more than a month. A study conducted in 76 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients showed that high viral RNA load is associated with the severity of the disease [24] . Furthermore, in a study conducted on a small group of 16 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients, viral RNA was positively detected in 50% of them, after resolution of symptoms for a median duration of 2.5 days and a maximum of eight days [25] . Therefore, the rapid decrease in viral RNA load is one element suggesting the effectiveness of this treatment. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the measurement of viral culture during treatment was also evaluated for the first time. The fall in culture positivity from the second day is remarkable, although, in a relatively small number of cases, some people maintain a positive culture. The second challenge is the rapid spread of the disease in the population through contagious individuals. The elimination of viral carriage in the human reservoir of the virus has recently been recognised as a priority [26] . To this end, the rapid decease in positivity in cultures from patients' respiratory samples under treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin supports an effectiveness of this combination. Thus, in addition to its direct therapeutic role, this combination can play a role in controlling the disease epidemic by limiting the duration of virus shedding, which can last for several weeks in the absence of specific treatment. In our Institute, which contains 75 individual rooms for treating highly contagious patients, we currently have a turnover rate of 1/3 per day which allows us to receive a large number of these contagious patients with early discharge.\",\n",
       " 'Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are extremely well-known drugs which have already been prescribed to billions of people. Because of anecdotical reports of heart complications with such drugs in patients with underlying conditions, it would be useful to perform an ECG before or at the very beginning of the treatment [27] . This problem is solved by hospitalising patients at risk in continuing care units with ECG monitoring allowing for the early detection and treatment of possible cardiac side-effects. Azithromycin is the drug that has been the most widely prescribed against respiratory infections and a recent (2010) study showed that one in eight American patients, has been prescribed azithromycin [28] . Indeed, there have probably been more than a billion azithromycin prescriptions around the world since it was first discovered. The toxicity of each of these two drugs does not, therefore, pose a major problem. Their possible toxicity in combination has been suggested in a few anecdotal reports but, to our knowledge, has never been demonstrated.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, we have provided evidence of a beneficial effect of co-administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early reduction of contagiousness. Given the urgent therapeutic need to manage this disease with effective and safe drugs, and the negligible cost of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, we believe that there is an urgent need to evaluate this strategy further, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold, and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.',\n",
       " 'Since the new coronavirus SARS (SARS-CoV2) has emerged from china, the infection has affected many countries and led to many deaths worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for virus to entry to the cell. ACE2 is a part of RAS which is expressed in several organs that opposes the AngII functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated about 3.4%, however, some comorbid conditions like underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of mortality. In addition, cardiovascular involvement by SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors which are expressed tremendously in heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by ARDS-induced hypoxia. Traditional risk factors could aggravate the process of COVID-19 infection that urges the triage of these high risk patients for SARS-CoV2. Currently, there is no effective, proven treatment or vaccination for COVID-19, but many investigators are struggling to find a treatment strategy as soon as possible. Some potential medications like chloroquine by itself or in combination with azithromycin, and some protease inhibitors used for the treatment of COVID-19 have cardiovascular adverse effects that should be kept in mind in order to close monitor of the patients receiving these medications.',\n",

Tizoxanide, a nitazoxanide metabolite, can inhibit the maturation of rotavirus viral protein 7 (VPN) (35) and the replication of flaviviruses, including dengue serotype 2, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever viruses (36, 37) , influenza virus and rotavirus (35) . Nitazoxanide has antiviral activity against MERS-CoV (38) and was able to block SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection at low-micromolar concentrations (10) . It also has been shown to induce type I IFN pathways by enhancing the RNA sensing axis that is usually trigged by foreign RNA cytoplasmic exposure (39) . Ivermectin has been described as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with in vitro activity (40, 41) . This broad-spectrum parasiticide has exhibited antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, such as influenza A, zika, West Nile, chikungunya, yellow fever, and dengue (42, 43) . The proposed mechanism of action for ivermectin is to inhibit viral replication by specifically targeting the activity of non-structural 3 helicase (NS3 helicase) in vitro (44) . The use of ivermectin to treat covid-19 patients was evaluated in an observational registry-based study involving critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.',\n",
       " 'Among the surviving children, 16 were hospitalized for critical deterioration of their underlying disease during COVID-19 infection with (n = 14) or without (n = 2) severe respiratory involvement. The primary results of laboratory investigations suggested an underlying inflammatory phenomenon and possible predisposition to prothrombotic events, as described in adult patients; however, further specialized investigations are needed to confirm this assumption [17] . Some patients received specific treatments including presumed antiviral treatments (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine) and/or anti-inflammatory drugs; one cannot analyze the possible efficacy of these treatments in this small series.',\n",

       " 'In the past 20 years, three novel human coronaviruses have emerged (29, 30) . The group 2b SARS-like CoV represent an existential and future threat to global health as evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Zoonotic SARS-like bat CoV strains can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, grow well in primary human airway cells, and vary by as much as 25% in key therapeutic and vaccine gene targets (11, 31) . Thus, to address the current public health emergency of COVID-19 and to maximize pandemic preparedness in the future, broad-based vaccines and therapeutics, which are active against the higher risk RNA virus families prone to emergence, are desperately needed. Small molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple mechanisms including blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking virus particle formation, or targeting a host factor required for replication (32) . Multiple direct acting antivirals are currently under evaluation in randomized control trials to treat COVID-19 including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir (33) (34) (35) . Here, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of NHC and its orally bioavailable prodrug EIDD-2801, against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the current pandemic strain SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelial cells. In addition to CoV, NHC is broadly active against multiple genetically distinct viruses including VEE, influenza A and B, Ebola, and Chikungunya viruses (13-16, 19, 21, 24, 36-38) . Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in mouse models of both SARS-and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the improvement in both SARSand MERS-CoV outcomes diminished with the delay of treatment initiation time, it is important to note that the kinetics of disease in mice are compressed as compared to that in humans. Whereas SARS-and MERS-CoV lung titers peak on 1-2 dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical signs and notable damage to the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms (19, 28, 39, 40) . Thus, in mice, the window within which to treat emerging CoV infection prior to peak replication is compressed (e.g., 24-48 hours). As with oseltamivir treatment for influenza which fails to provide a protective effect if administered >5 days after the onset of symptoms, the window in which to treat COVID-19 patients prior to peak virus replication is likely during the first week of symptoms when pharyngeal shedding is at its highest (41, 42) . However, virus replication and shedding may continue for several weeks in the most severe COVID-19 patients (34) . Thus, early intervention with an antiviral like EIDD-2801 is likely to provide the most clinical benefit although there may opportunities in severe patients where the duration of virus replication may be extended. Our current study is clearly limited by the lack of in vivo efficacy testing with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, robust mouse models that recapitulate the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis observed in humans do not yet exist due to a noted virus spike glycoprotein and mouse ACE2 receptor incompatibility complicating the evaluation of medical countermeasures (43, 44) . In addition, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity increases with increasing age. Our studies are limited by the lack of drug efficacy testing in CoV aged mouse models that recapitulate the age-related increase in pathogenesis observed in humans (45) . The data provided in this manuscript suggest that EIDD-2801 should be quickly evaluated in primate models of human disease, using immediate models for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis or newly described cynomolgus and rhesus macaque models for SARS-CoV-2 (46) (47) (48) (49) .',\n",

Among the 48 drugs that were evaluated in our study, 24 drugs showed potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 values in Second, ciclesonide is another interesting drug candidate for further development although its antiviral potency was much lower (IC 50 = 4.33 µM) than niclosamide.

       " 'Our structure-based virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs, followed by in vitro and in vivo activity assays, has demonstrated that multiple FDA-approved drugs, including lapatinib, can significantly inhibit mPGES-1. Thus, these FDA-approved drugs could also have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, depending on their actual pharmacokinetic profiles associated with the actual dosage forms. Further clinical data mining revealed that lapatinib has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile to ensure that the lapatinib concentrations in various tissues can reach the levels that are significantly higher than the IC 50 value after orally taking a lower dose of lapatinib. So, lapatinib may serve as a highly desired anti-inflammatory drug targeting mPGES-1 to treat inflammation and pain as well as a variety of other inflammation-related diseases. For example, the recently identified COVID-19 causes serious lung inflammation. It would be interesting to test whether lapatinib can be used to effectively suppress the inflammation caused by COVID-19 while an antiviral drug (such as remdesivir or chloroquine or hydroxylchloroquine or any other antiviral drug to be approved by the FDA) is used to kill the virus in the body.',\n",
       " 'When COVID-19 broke out in China, clinicians and researchers lacked knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. At that time, saving lives was the most important thing to be considered. Many un-approved treatments were therefore tested in the clinic based on the experience of SARS and in vitro studies. As the evidence grew, many drugs were not proved to be effective treatments for COVID-19. Also, chloroquine lopinavir/ritonavir and other drugs have been reported to have toxic effects. This is why there have been seven editions of the Chinese Guidelines. When COVID-19 broke out in Europe and American in the second wave, clinicians had already gained more knowledge and could avoid unnecessary tests through evidence-based medicine. European and Americans have also developed corresponding guidelines for COVID-19. There is much to be learned from the self-renewal and self-improvement practices of medical staff under the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of updating guidelines is not only helpful to global anti-COVID-19 practice but is also valuable for mankind, as we are still facing the threat of pandemics of undiscovered pathogens in the future.',\n",
       " 'Of huge importance now is to provide a fast, cost-effective, safe, and immediately available pharmaceutical solution to curb the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2. Recent publications on SARS-CoV-2 have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Whether chloroquine can treat SARS-CoV-2 alone and also work as a prophylactic is doubtful. An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a protease inhibitor or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor. Using bromhexine at a dosage that selectively inhibits TMPRSS2 and, in so doing, inhibits TMPRSS2-specific viral entry is likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment. We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment. If proven to be effective, this would allow a rapid, accessible, and cost-effective application worldwide.',\n",

Due to scarcity of the suitable treatment strategy, the present study was undertaken to explore host protein(s) targeted by potent repurposed drug(s) in COVID-19. Materials and methods: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from microarray data repository of SARS-CoV patient blood. The repurposed drugs for COVID-19 were selected from available literature. Using DEGs and drugs, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and chemo-protein interaction (CPI) networks were constructed and combined to develop an interactome model of PPI-CPI network. The top-ranked sub-network with its hub-bottleneck nodes were evaluated with their functional annotations. Key findings: A total of 120 DEGs and 65 drugs were identified. The PPI-CPI network (118 nodes and 293 edges) exhibited a top-ranked sub-network (35 nodes and 174 connectivities) with 12 hub-bottleneck nodes having two drugs chloroquine and melatonin in association with 10 proteins corresponding to six upregulated and four downregulated genes. Two drugs interacted directly with the hub-bottleneck node i.e. matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), a host protein corresponding to its upregulated gene. MMP9 showed functional annotations associated with neutrophil mediated immunoinflammation. Moreover, literature survey revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus, might have functional cooperativity with MMP9 and a possible interaction with both drugs.',\n",

       " 'The cell culture study (kidney cell line Vero E6) and network analysis reveal that chloroquine [85] and melatonin [21] respectively may have potential anti-viral role in targeting human cell membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, a zinc dependent carboxypeptidase, and other associated protein partners in COVID-19. Interestingly, separate studies report that MMP9 level increases in ACE2-knockout mice model [86] and ACE inhibitors (lisinopril and imidapril) also target MMP9 along with ACE2 [87] . Therefore, both metallopeptidases i.e. ACE2 and MMP9 may have cooperativities for immunoinflammation in COVID-19 and can be potential targets of both chloroquine and melatonin therapies.

In vitro studies also indicate that the soluble ACE2 can bind to SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and is supposed to limit the availability of viruses to interact with the membrane-bound ACE2 receptors thus minimizing the chances of viral load [88, 92, 94] . Notably, ACE2 converts angiotensin-II to angiotensin(1-7), a peptide which causes modification of inflammatory processes [97] . Angiotensin(1-7) also has a vasodilatory effect [98] and enhances the heart rate acting on the caudal ventrolateral medulla in the brain [99] , which may contribute to the development of hypotension and tachycardia as found in SARS/COVID-19 patients [100] .',\n",

However, in our cohort the high mortality rate was observed over a longer follow-up period than in other published, uncontrolled experiences with tocilizumab. In addition, this elevated mortality rate did not differ from what is reported in other cohorts of severely ill patients in whom different treatments other than tocilizumab were used [11] .

While there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, several drugs approved for other indications are being investigated in clinical trials. These treatments are based on the administration of agents that either block the virus entry inside the host cells stopping virus replication and infection of other cells, or potentially inhibit protease activity (i.e. lopinavir/ ritonavirin antiviral drugs). Other potential treatments under clinical investigations use either nucleoside analogues that target the RNA-dependent polymerase suppressing viral RNA synthesis (i.e. Remdesivir), or directly act on the virion assembly and budding and alter the molecular crosstalk of SARS-CoV-2 while indirectly reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or activating anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cells (i.e. (Hydroxy)-Chloroquine).

There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19.

However, lacking is a temperance in enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect bystander cells.

Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg /kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age ± SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 ± 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 ± 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 ± 2.75 versus 13.22 ±5.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82). No adverse events were observed Conclusions : Add-on use of IVM to HCQ and AZT had better effectiveness, shorter hospital stay, and relatively safe compared with controls. however, a larger prospective study with longer follow up may be needed to validate these results.',\n",

Further, anecdotal data indicate that no COVID-19 patient with multiorgan failure has survived ECMO, prompting several institutions to set multiorgan failure as a contraindication. Based on our patient, multiorgan failure including acute renal failure may not signify an insurmountable scenario to contraindicate the use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 patients.',\n",

Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine ± azithromycin combination is associated with significant gastrointestinal disturbances and patients have to be closely monitoring for toxicity (in particular QTc prolongation). Lopinavir/ritonavir can also cause diarrhea. It is also a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, a dose adjustment of the calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus/ cyclosporine), is needed. 41, 42 Preliminary data based on the compassionate use of remdesivir appear promising with 68% of patients showing clinical improvement. 43 This may be a possible therapeutic option, and we eagerly await the results of ongoing remdesivir clinical trials. 40 Where possible, we recommend the enrollment of affected patients into the remdesivir clinical trials. For those who do not qualify, we recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine. In patients with severe illness, the use of convalescent serum or immunomodulatory therapy with tocilizumab may be considered on a case-by-case basis. 44 There is no strong evidence on how to modify immunosuppression during acute COVID-19. The severe illness associated with COVID-19 is associated with an intense inflammatory response. However, there is no proven benefit in the use of corticosteroids, and potential deleterious effects (eg, prolonged viral clearance and risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections) exists. 41, 44 On the other hand, it is also not entirely clear how to reduce or discontinue immunosuppression. Although it may bolster native immune responses, it risks graft rejection which will be a devastating complication due to the treatment required to reverse it. Presently, centers with experience managing COVID-19 in transplant recipients recommend dose reduction of antimetabolites or calcineurin inhibitors in those with severe infections. 41, 42 In this pandemic, the patient, transplanted or not, is similarly at the risk of succumbing to COVID-19 either as a patient with end-stage organ failure or immunosuppressed after transplant. At each phase of the outbreak, the decision to proceed with transplantation must be guided by the indication for transplant, availability of manpower and resources, and overall safety of all parties involved in the procedure. The known and unknown risks of transplantation are certainly increased amid this COVID-19 pandemic. However, these risks may be mitigated if the locale practices an effective containment policy, due to diligence made to exclude COVID-19 in both donor and recipient, and there are robust infectious prevention processes within the hospital. As more data emerge, it is likely that we will gain more knowledge to make the process even safer. Management strategies of COVID-19 after transplant will continue to evolve as more data emerge.',\n",

Furthermore, disease management has been challenging for the clinicians and other medical personnel in terms of treatment options and the availability of personal protective equipment. The off-label use of some drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and emergency use authorization of remdesivir can hopefully help the clinicians while treating critically ill patients.

In this cohort, 89% of patients achieved viral RNA clearance within 21 days, and only 66% within 14 days. Specifically, all asymptomatic patients achieved viral RNA clearance within 21 days.

       " 'The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral and antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues playing a key role in their mechanism of action. The docking studies were carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further studies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein targets, molecular dynamics studies, invitro and in-vivo biological evaluation are required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of the viral life cycle.',\n",

This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19. A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro. In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020. In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells. Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection. Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.',\n",

Confirming empirical data it was found that global trends indicated that higher malaria incidence correlated well with lower case burden of Covid-19. The prevalent use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in malaria endemic zones could be a reason for the reduced case burden and burden of mortality from Covid-19 in these areas. The protective effect of the BCG vaccine was quantified in terms of its correlation with reduced incidence of Covid-19 and was found almost equal in magnitude to the deleterious effect of age. It has been hypothesised that in addition to trained immunity, higher levels of Type 1 interferon was responsible for this protective effect.

A large number of patients have been cured but the attribution to survival by these drugs has been controversial. Till date, we do not have any specific drug or vaccine available for COVID-19 and the pandemic seems to be far from over. To handle the current challenges posed by the outbreak effectively, we need to employ innovative interdisciplinary approaches. Organ-onchip (OOC), particularly lung-on-chip, is one such approach which combines the potential of microfluidics, cell culture and molecular biology into a single miniaturised platform. The device is realized to be capable of simulating in-vivo physiological responses of an organ. In the current study, an OOC, which is a multichannel 3D cell culture microfluidic device, is made via soft lithography technique, using polydimethylsiloxane-polymer and diverse polymeric porous/semipermeable membranes. Several polymer membranes i.e. PDMS, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nitrocellulose, polyester etc., integrated into the microdevices, were efficiently explored to realize their better cell-adhesion and viability property.

Gautret et al 2020 is among one of the first purportedly positive trials of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is imperative that a thorough analysis and understanding of trial data be undertaken prior to making claims about safety and efficacy. Our group assessed the statistical robustness of the trial using the Fragility Index (FI). The FI provides a numerical quantification of a clinical trial's conclusions. The index is based on iterative statistical calculations to determine the minimum number of events within a trial that would theoretically need to change from positive to negative in order for the trial's endpoint to convert from significant to non-significant; the higher the index, the more statistically robust the study results. For the Gautret et al trial, one endpoint had an FI of 1, two had indices of 2, and another had an index of 4. The primary endpoint of viral clearance on day 6 had an FI of 4. This indicates that if 4 events were to change from positive to negative, the conclusion of the trial would become mathematically non-significant. This index is comparable to many other published trials of established agents; the median FI across the reported literature appears to be 2. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust, assuming that data quality is not compromised; however, the study was an open-label trial with non-homogenous groups, with analysis conducted per-protocol.\",\n",

Despite its international aggressive extension, with a significant morbidity and mortality, the impact of renal function on its prognosis is uncertain. Methods Analysis from the international HOPE-Registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to evaluate the association between kidney failure severity on admission with the mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were categorized in 3 groups according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate on admission (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Results 758 patients were included: mean age was 66 ± 18 years, and 58.6% of patient were male. Only 8.5% of patients had a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, 30% of patients had kidney dysfunction upon admission (eGFR < 60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 ). These patients received less frequently pharmacological treatment with hydroxychloroquine or antivirals and had a greater number of complications such as sepsis (11.9% vs 26.4% vs 40.8%, p < 0.001) and respiratory failure (35.4% vs 72.2% vs 62.0%, p < 0.001) as well as a higher in-hospital mortality rate (eGFR > 60 vs eGFR 30-60 vs and eGFR < 30, 18.4% vs 56.5% vs 65.5%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis: age, hypertension, renal function, 0 2 saturation < 92% and lactate dehydrogenase elevation on admission independently predicted all-cause mortality. Conclusions Renal failure on admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequent and is associated with a greater number of complications and in-hospital mortality.

Additionally, COVID-19 can lead to cardiovascular injury and myocarditis; experimental treatments such as hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin might also lead to increased cardiac events. 17 Acute cardiac events have been observed in patients with COVID-19, including acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, and arrhythmias, therefore making OHCA a possible direct complication of COVID-19. Finally, a major prothrom botic state has been reported during COVID-19 infections, with a consequent increase in thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolisms and acute coronary syndromes. 18 To the best of our knowledge, only one original report described an increase in OHCA incidence in Lombardy, Italy, a specific setting where the pandemic was more prolific than what was observed in most regions worldwide. 6, 7 Overwhelming of medical services occurred and rules were set to prioritise hospital admissions and intubation among patients with COVID-19. This issue could have led to several deaths from COVID-19 occurring at home and being counted as OHCA, as suggested by the high rate of COVID-19 suspicion or diagnosis among patients who had an OHCA, which accounted for 77% of the surge in OHCA cases in Lombardy. Conversely, in our study, we provide a picture of the surge of OHCA in a setting where a severe pandemic was observed, but the health-care system was still able to handle all known COVID-19 cases without specific limitations, leading to a much lower proportion of cases being related to COVID-19 infection.',\n",

In our opinion, the final list of the \"hematological\" drugs that could represent promising options in the COVID-19 war might include also Ruxolitinib, Bosutinib, Imatinib and Begelomab. Ruxolitinib probably is the fastest and more powerful agent in the switching off the cytokine storm, as already shown in aGVHD and also in the first COVID-19 cases treated with this JAK1/2 inhibitor. Nevertheless, its doubtful safety from the infective point of view probably might impose at least the need of a careful observation of the immunocompetence in COVID-19 patients, also considering that super-infections have been documented in 8.5% of them. TKIs could be tried as further options: in different models of inflammations, Bosutinib showed optimal anti-inflammatory properties, already demonstrated by its ability of reverting the pro-inflammatory effects of Dasatinib. In addition, data coming from the experience in CML sustain its good safety profile and sustain the hypothesis of a rapid efficacy also. Imatinib displays a good anti-inflammatory effect, its use is characterized by a low infection rate; it is worth to remember also that Imatinib remain the cheapest drug and probably the TKI most frequently available worldwide. Begelomab, probably for a short period of time, might also be an interesting option for its capacity of destroying the strict negative link between Coronavirus and inflammation actors.',\n",

       " 'Several host factors regulate the replication of coronaviruses and they simultaneously induce dramatic changes in the host cellular structure and function. T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction that arises during many chronic infections and cancer. It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells (10) . Persistent stimulation by the virus may induce T cell exhaustion, leading to loss of cytokine production and reduced function (11) (12) . The number of total T cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care. This case report describes that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and BALF analysis for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but showing residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. We speculate that the virus migrates from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract as the infection progresses, which may explain the negative test results of nasopharyngeal swabs. The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to cure a COVID-19 patient, and clinical trials indicate that this drug may have significant potential as an antiviral (13-14-15) . There are some limitations to this report that must be considered. Our context comes from a single patient treated with remdesivir in the course of the disease. This patient also received hydroxychloroquine, large spectrum antibiotic, Janus kinase inhibitor, anti-JAK, and Tocilizumab. It is possible that these medications may have impacted his clinical course. He is also a 50-year-old patient with few comorbidities and his most significant risk factor for mortality is a history of Follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma previously treated with chemotherapy in 2018, with additional recurrent pneumonia infection.',\n",
       " 'Counterproductive lung inflammation and dysregulated thrombosis contribute importantly to the lethality of advanced COVID-19. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic -azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline -might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus; a large case series evaluating this combination in early-stage patients reported an impressively low mortality rate. However, whereas HCQ and AZM can promote QT interval lengthening and may be contraindicated in more advanced COVID-19 entailing cardiac damage, doxycycline has no such effect and exerts a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to HCQ, we propose that the combination of PTX + DIP can be used in both early and advanced stages of COVID-19. Concurrent use of certain nutraceuticals -yeast beta-glucan, zinc, vitamin D, spirulina, phase 2 inducers, Nacetylcysteine, glucosamine, quercetin, and magnesium -might also improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19.',\n",

Finally, although baricitinib has the potential to affect SARS-CoV2 penetration into pulmonary epithelial cells, major concerns remain about the inhibition of IFNs activity which could be detrimental in the course of viral infection.',\n",
       " 'The clinical picture of our patient was in keeping with GBS according to Brighton criteria, with increasing flaccid weakness of the limbs, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation, and consistent neurophysiologic data. Other causes of concurrent neurotoxicities were also excluded, as hydroxichloroquine generally accounts for different side effects and antiretrovirals had yet to be administered when she started having neurological symptoms. Intensive supportive care and the need for strict isolation impaired clinical and instrumental assessment of the neurological aspect, despite being critical to determine prognosis. Remarkably, contrary to the previous reported case with COVID-19 [2] , our patient developed neurological deficits a week after the onset of respiratory symptoms and they progressed simultaneously; therefore, the evolution of her clinical picture does not support the typical post-infectious pattern of GBS and it could rather resemble a form of acute para-infectious paralysis that has already been associated with some viruses, such as ZIKV [3] . Indeed, this ZIK-V manifestation has peculiar characteristics that led to speculation about a possible different pathogenesis compared to classical GBS: (a) they seem to arise 5 to 10 days after infection and have higher morbidity, more frequent cranial neuropathies and concurrent immune-mediated disorders such as thrombocytopenic purpura [4] ; (b) anti-glycolipids antibodies typically involved in cross-reactive mechanisms are not common [5] ; (c) there is a predominant involvement of distal nerve segments [3] , where the blood-nerve barrier is lacking.',\n",

In this situation, medications transposition is a critical need to find effective anti-inflammatory agents in order to decrease the cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors production (14) .

Besides, outcome of a new experimental study conducted by Liu et al. has been mentioned in the title of their publication as follows: \"Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro\".

Moreover, Molina et al. have followed 11 patients with HCQ + azithromycin regimen and concluded no clinical benefit and reasonable antiviral activity in this regard (11) . In addition, pre-print of a Quasi-Randomized Comparative Study conducted in Detroit, Michigan, has been indicated not only no clinical benefits for HCQ, but even increased need for urgent respiratory support (p=0.013) (19) .',\n",

Authors recommend that scientific communities have to be very cautious and do not rush in decision when there is no ample evidence for the subject, especially in such critical situations, which can lead to irreparable consequences.

       " \"The novel coronavirus spike (S) protein attaches to the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and cleaved by serine proteases to gain access into the human cell. 4 ACE 2 is widely distributed in the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, oral, and nasal mucosa. COVID-19 causes activated T-cell response and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. In severe cases, these increased levels can cause a cytokine storm and damages healthy tissue than the virus. 4, 5 COVID-19 causes mostly fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath, which in most cases are self-limiting. Some individuals harbor the virus and are asymptomatic. They play a crucial role in the spread of the virus in the community. 1 COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs causing dyspnea, hypoxia, and can cause severe infections resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In severe cases, patients often need intensive care unit admission causing multi-organ failure and death. 1 COVID-19 co-circulates in the environment along with other respiratory viruses and, most importantly, influenza. The study from a hospital in Wuhan, which analyzed the epidemiological, demographic, and laboratory data from the COVID-19 and influenza cases visited between January 2017 and February 2020. There was a decreased number of influenza A and B cases in 2020 compared with the previous years. COVID-19 interfered with the seasonal influenza epidemic. There were 9 coinfection cases of influenza and COVID-19 reported in 1054 cases. 6 As per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates from 2018-2019, approximately 35 million people were infected with influenza that resulted in approximately half million hospitalizations. Thirty-four thousand patients died from influenza last year. 3 A double-center study was done in China to analyze coinfections of common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19. A total of 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited, 38 from Wuhan and 30 from Quingdao. Among them, 24 (80%) patients from Quingdao had an immunoglobulin M antibody against 1 respiratory pathogen, compared with only 1 patient in Wuhan. The most common respiratory pathogens detected were influenza A, influenza B in the majority of cases, followed by Mycoplasma pneumonia and Legionella pneumophilia. This shows that the coinfection pattern differs significantly depending on the geographic area. 7 In an experience described by Wuhan, only 5 patients among 115 were coinfected with influenza and COVID-19. In those 5 patients, 3 patients had influenza A, and 2 patients had influenza B. All the patients had a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Two patients developed fatigue, myalgia, headache, and expectoration. Three patients had pharyngalgia, which appeared more in the patients who developed coinfection. Only 1 patient developed chest pain and hemoptysis. The laboratory data revealed lymphocytopenia and elevated C-reactive protein in 4 patients, elevated transaminases, and procalcitonin levels in 2 patients. Lymphocyte count improved during the remission of the disease. The renal function and coagulation function was normal in these patients. Only 1 patient among the 5 patients developed ARDS and needed noninvasive-assisted ventilation and improved. The chest CT of the patient who developed ARDS had significant ground-glass opacities and subsegmental areas of consolidation that correlated with the clinical picture. Acute liver injury was noted in 3 patients and diarrhea in 2 patients. All patients were treated with antiviral therapy, including oseltamivir, antibiotic therapy, and received supplemental oxygen. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids. No one needed care in intensive care unit, and all the patients were discharged home. 8 Wu et al reported a case of a 69-year-old male who presented with fever and dry cough after visiting Wuhan during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. The patient's CT revealed ground-glass consolidation in the right lung inferior lobes. COVID-19 was suspected, nasopharyngeal swab specimen resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2 on repeated testing, but yielded positive for influenza A. The patient was discharged on oral oseltamivir and was instructed to remain in isolation at home. Subsequently, in a week, the patient developed ARDS and lymphopenia. Repeated testing by nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample was negative. The patient was subsequently intubated, and finally, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case highlights that both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 mimic the clinical picture, and often the diagnosis of COVID-19 can be missed with false-negative tests for the upper respiratory specimen. If the suspicion for COVID-19 is high, repeated testing should be performed. 9 Four cases of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza were reported from Iran. Three of the patients were males, relatively younger, except for 1 patient, and only 1 patient has comorbidities. All the patients had a cough, dyspnea, and fever, while the majority had headache and myalgia. One patient had gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority had lymphopenia and elevated inflammatory markers. All the patients had radiological abnormalities. Significant renal failure was noted in 1 patient, and liver failure was noted in 2 patients. No outcomes were described in the patients. 10 Drug used There is no proven therapy for COVID-19 till now; meticulous supportive care holds key. The patients are getting treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, as seen in our case series and in severe cases, interleukin-6 antibodies. Novel nucleoside analog-like remdesivir was also used. The treatment with steroids is controversial. There have been many emerging and experimental therapies described. Many clinical trials are underway across the globe to check the efficacy of different medications in COVID-19. In a few centers, the convalescent serum has been used. Patients with influenza should be treated with oseltamivir. Multiple clinical trials are under investigation as summarized in Table 2 . 11 Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 cause mostly similar symptoms, and the coinfection did not significantly worsen the symptoms or outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'In three Chinese series performed with heterogeneous samples of cancer patients, they described that the most frequent type of tumor in their series was lung cancer [8] [9] [10] . However, only one of them described a higher susceptibility and severity for Covid-19 in NSCLC [9] . In the other two remaining studies, they indicated that this population is the most frequently infected as we previously have indicated [9] [10] . Nevertheless in the study by Liang W did not find that lung cancer patients had a higher risk of complications compared to the rest of the oncology population from their work [9] . These results are likely to be found in this study because most of its patients were cancer survivors. In our study, most of the lung cancer patients had active disease or were on active treatment. This is why we probably obtained a higher mortality rate, being more representative of the real world in oncology departments. Refusal to ICU admission could also act as a determining factor. These data are similar to those recently reported by Garassino MC [11] . They observed a lower mortality rate (33.3%), but they also agree that a determining fact in these deaths, was the refusal to ICU admission. These considerations will guide us to make better recommendations. Furthermore, none of these three published studies [9] [10] [11] provide specific data on Covid-19 treatment outcome. In our study, we have checked in the multivariate analysis that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination may be a good treatment option in patients with lung cancer with just one dead patient, but we cannot draw conclusions due to the limited number of cases of our study.',\n",
       " 'In order to identify potential cells and tissue types that may be associated with the EHR-derived clinical phenotypes observed above for COVID-19 patients, we analyzed Single Cell RNA-seq data using the nferX platform (see Methods) 9 . Given recent studies implicating the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle 10 , we scouted for human cells that co-express both genes. This co-expression analysis revealed that specific cell types from the small intestine/colon, nasal cavity, respiratory system, pancreas, urinary tract, and gallbladder co-express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figure 1, Figure S1 ). Notably, multiple small intestine cell types co-express the two genes. These cell types include enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, stem cells, goblet cells, and Paneth cells. In the pancreas, the cell types included ductal cells and acinar cells. The kidney cells co-expressing TMPRSS2 and ACE2 include proximal tubular cells, pelvic epithelial cells and type A intercalated cells. Co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 is also observed in the epithelial cells of the olfactory nasal cavity and the respiratory tract as well as in type II pneumocytes (albeit at comparatively lower level). While the identified tissues showing co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastro-intestinal, respiratory, and sensory systems correlate with the clinical phenotypes of early COVID-19 infection as described above, these insights are conceivably from normal/healthy tissues. This highlight the need for meticulous bio-banking of COVID-19 patient-derived biospecimen and their characterization via single cell RNA-seq and other molecular technologies. Primary prevention is the most effective method to minimize spread of contagious infectious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure S2 ). In addition to population-based strategies such as social distancing, there are significant ongoing efforts to develop a prophylactic solution ( Table S2) . As the immunodominant humoral immune response in patients is directed against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein, many vaccines under investigation target this viral protein. It remains to be determined whether anti-spike protein antibodies induced by natural infection or by vaccines induce neutralizing antibody responses. Chloroquine and its analogues have been shown to inhibit virus replication in-vitro 28 . Whether Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine have meaningful effects of SARS-CoV2 replication in patients remains to be understood, and are the subject of clinical trials, both as post-exposure prophylaxis and as treatment (Table S2) . Hydroxychloroquine was approved by FDA for emergency use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are not eligible for clinical trials on April 7, 2020 based on limited clinical data, but concerns have been raised about toxicity and risk of sudden death 29 .',\n",

While considerable efforts are being made to \"flatten the curve\", it does not negate the damage that has already been done, particularly in the African American community. While the virus is not thought to target specific racial or ethnic groups, we cannot ignore that African Americans have been disproportionately impacted. As we think about getting past this crisis and getting back to \"normal\", the pandemic provides an opportunity to improve our health system to reduce disparities. In sum, understanding the key biological and psychosocial contributors to the ravishes of COVID-19 in African Americans highlights the need for more vigilance, attention, and efforts to improve health for all.'"

      " 'the prevalent use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in malaria endemic zones could be a reason for the reduced case burden and burden of mortality from covid-19 in these areas.'\n",
      " 'the results showed that the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significantly decreased fatality risk (unadjusted hr: 0.31; 95% ci: 0.16-0.61; p=0.001; adjusted hr: 0.36; 95% ci: 0.18-0.75; p=0.006) ( table 3) , which further supports that the critically ill patients can benefit substantially from hydroxychloroquine treatment.'\n",
      " 'following points can be concluded and to be considered during the use of aminoquinolines (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for the treatment of covid-19 infection –i)history of previous or ongoing use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in malaria, amebiasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus;ii)higher risk of development of retinopathy in asian patients;iii)periodical monitoring of patients with vision problems, cardiovascular problems;iv)to measure central and peripheral visual acuity;v)drug interaction with kaolin clay and antacids reduces antiviral and anti-inflammatory action;vi)regular monitoring for symptoms like ocular pruritus and cardiac arrhythmias;vii)aminoquinolines decreases activity of immunosupressants and antibiotics;viii)other aminoquinoline analog, mefloquine is associated with increased risk of convulsion;ix)the toxicity is associated with the dose calculated by real weight and therefore dose should be suitable for patients with potential high risk of adverse effects.'\n",
      " 'intriguingly, during hydroxychloroquine coadministration, aceis/arbs were associated with lower hazards of mortality and the need for invasive ventilation, reinforcing previous findings of their lack of detriment in covid-19.'\n",

      " 'randomized clinical trials are needed to identify safe and effective treatments for covid-19, including those that definitively delineate the incidence of adverse effects and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients.'\n",
      " 'surprisingly, an increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone, enforcing the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.'\n",
      " 'we anticipate that clinicians may be asked to recognize and manage this toxidrome in increasing frequency as attention on hydroxychloroquine as potential pharmacotherapy for covid-19 disease may be popularized, despite an increasing concern on the increased mortality associated with this treatment [4, 5].'\n",
      " 'our findings on mortality should be interpreted cautiously due to the inclusion of studies with differences in age group, co-morbidity, co-interventions and severity of disease in hydroxychloroquine and supportive care patients.'\n",
      " 'our finding of clinically actionable qtc prolongation in 7% of our cohort is closely aligned with the findings of saleh and colleagues 12 whose study employed a similar hydroxychloroquine dosing protocol, but substantially lower than other series with higher absolute daily drug dosage of hydroxychloroquine, higher rates of concomitant qt prolonging medication use, and higher rates of intensive care unit status.'\n",
      " 'this result is consistent with a recent small clinical trial in brazil, which was terminated due to increased mortality in the high-dose chloroquine arm of the study.2 an improved safety profile may be a reason for clinicians to favor the chloroquine derivative hydroxychloroquine for covid-19,23 but this drug is also associated with cardiac adverse events.3 the simulations of virtual populations suggest that women with pre-existing heart disease will be most at greatest risk of arrhythmia during treatment with these drugs.']\n"
