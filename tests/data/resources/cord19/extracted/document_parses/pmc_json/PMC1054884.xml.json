Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range [4,5,6,7] or increasing their virulence [8,9], thus accompanying, or perhaps even being at the origin of, major changes during virus adaptation. It remains unclear, however, whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses.",

Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms, such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented [10], intra-molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates (in RNA viruses) [11], or homologous or non-homologous recombination (in both RNA and DNA viruses). Quantification of viral recombination in multi-cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches: in vitro (in cell cultures) [12,13,14,15], and in vivo (in live hosts) [16,17,18]. The in vitro approach, which has so far been applied only to animal viruses, allows the establishment of the \u201cintrinsic\u201d recombination rate in experimentally co-infected cells in cell cultures [14,15,19]. However, it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire, living hosts, where the frequency of co-infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population, the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants, and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells. The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in \u201cthe real world.\u201d",

            "text": "However, as discussed below, numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination. First, many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection, where only recombinant genomes were viable (e.g., [13,20,21]). Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues [18,22,23,24,25], which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population. So far, no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host. Finally, recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate, rather than the individual recombination rate [1,26,27]. While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account, there are other caveats: isolates have often been collected in different hosts\u2014sometimes in different geographical regions\u2014and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established. Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale.",

Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non-segmented double-stranded DNA genome. After entering the host cell nucleus, the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome [28] whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II [29]. The CaMV genome consists in approximately 8,000 bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta (Figure 1) [30]. Viral proteins P1 to P6 are expressed from two major transcripts, namely a 19S RNA, encoding P6, and a 35S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P1\u2013P5 [31]. Using the pre-genomic 35S RNA as a matrix, the protein P5 (product of gene V) reverse-transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated [30].",

            "text": "The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times. Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation (i) of a host plant with two infectious or non-infectious parental clones [21,32,33,34,35] or (ii) of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region [36]. While the former revealed inter-genomic viral recombination, the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host's genome. Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and, hence, multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus [37]. Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that, in some cases, CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus, between different viral minichromosomes, presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery [21,35]. Nevertheless, the mechanism of \u201ctemplate switching\u201d during reverse transcription, predominant in all retroviruses, most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses. For this reason, and on the basis of numerous experimental data, CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell, by \u201clegal\u201d template switching between two pre-genomic RNA molecules [21,35,36,38,39], or \u201cillegal\u201d template switching between the 19S and the 35S RNA [36,40]. Under this hypothesis, recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription, with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA (position 0 in Figure 1). The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine. However, since these studies are based on complementation techniques, non-quantitative detection, or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination, they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an \u201ceveryday\u201d process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations.",

Altogether, the recombinant genomes averaged over 50% of the population. Further analysis of these data, assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to 20, indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude, i.e., on the order of a few 10\u22125, across the entire genome.

Indeed, the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi-cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease. Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect, basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non-infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness, on phylogenetically based analyses, or on experiments in cell cultures. For reasons detailed in the Introduction, the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination, but only its occurrence, or address the question at a different temporal, and often spatial, scale. Results from cell cultures, on the other hand, impose cell co-infection by different viral variants, potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events. Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection, and therefore the invasion and co-infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural.",

The time length of one generation, i.e., the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next, is totally unknown in plant viruses. The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts, where the capsid protein is produced between 48 and 72 h [40]. The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena [30], we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of 2 d and, thus, an average of ten generations during our experiments. In case this estimate is mistaken, we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations, thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established. At this point, we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments. It was previously shown that about 95% of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies [41], where they may be sequestered for a long time, as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells, including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks. The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate. In order to minimize this bias, the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf, where the chances of finding genomes from \u201cunsequestered lines\u201d were assumed to be higher. In any case, our data analysis is conservative, since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate.",

            "text": "Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative: a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci. We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts. Indeed, one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype. In the former, analogous to clonal propagation, recombination is undetectable. In the latter, recombination is not only detectable but, as our results indicate, very frequent. Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events, thus yielding an impression of negative interference. These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models. It is indeed easy to show (detailed results not shown) that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally, analogous to single infections, while the remaining reproduces panmictically, negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist. For example, assuming a three-locus model with real recombination rates r\n1 and r\n2 and interference i\n12, the \u201capparent\u201d recombination and interference parameters, would be r\n1 = (1 \u2212 F)r1, r\n2 = (1 \u2212 F)r\n2, and i\n12 = \u2212(F \u2212 i\n12)/(1 \u2212 F). Interestingly, this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative: that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate.",

The values for r\n1,\nr\n2, and r\n3 are remarkably similar, hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome. We considered the template-switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV. As already mentioned in the Introduction, hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the 5\u2032 extremities of the 35S and 19S RNAs [21,36,42]. If other recombination mechanisms, such as that associated with second-strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery, act significantly, hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption \u03941, \u03942, and \u03943 [43]. Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers, we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the 5\u2032 end of the 35S RNA and to \u03941 (at nucleotide position 0). Nevertheless, the putative hot spots at the 5\u2032 end of the 19S RNA and at \u03942 and \u03943 (nucleotide positions 4,220 and 1,635, respectively) fall between marker pairs c\u2013d, b\u2013c, and a\u2013b, respectively. Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent\u2014though predicted by different recombination mechanisms\u2014or, more likely, that they simply do not exist. Whatever the explanation, what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome, and thus any gene thereof, with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection.",

In contrast, retroviruses and particularly HIV-1 have been extensively investigated in that sense. As we have already discussed for these latter cases, the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co-infected cell cultures. The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV-1 is on the order of 10\u22124 [14,15,19], less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV.

After the precipitation step of this protocol, the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States) in TE 1X (100 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA [pH 8]). Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a, b, c, or d and submitted to a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV. Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb-S DNA and twice in Mark-S, thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes. After scanning the agarose gels, we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position, by densitometry using the NIH 1.62 Image program.

Consequently, we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the 21 d that infection lasted in our experiment (we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection). Based on the kinetics of gene expression [40], we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between 2 and 3 d, and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time. In case this assumption is incorrect, we did calculations assuming five, seven, ten, or 20 replication cycles during these 21 d. As shown, the results were not affected qualitatively, and only slightly quantitatively. It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template-switching mechanism, and that therefore, from a recombination point of view, the CaMV genome is linear. The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position 0 in Figure 1, which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome. This implies that changes between contiguous markers a\u2013b, b\u2013c, and c\u2013d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot, as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA, during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a\u2013b, b\u2013c, or c\u2013d.",

Instead, we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations, given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters. For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies, and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance. In all cases, the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci.",

The thick arrows with different textures represent the organization of open reading frames I to VI, encoding proteins detected in planta. Markers a, b, c, and d were engineered at the positions indicated (see Materials and Methods for precise positions). The inner black arrows represent monocistronic 19S RNA and polycistronic 35S RNA produced by the cellular machinery. The nucleotide position 0 (numbering according to [44]) indicates the origin of replication via reverse transcription, which occurs in the direction indicated by the dotted outermost circle-like arrow. Reverse transcription is accomplished by the viral reverse transcriptase, using the 35S RNA as template [49].",
